< Stability tests for double layer capacitors by cycling and voltage hold were compared.
< The voltage hold test turns out to be more demanding than the cycle test.
< The same capacitance loss was observed after much shorter test time for the voltage hold test.
< The cycle test overestimated the voltage limit for stability by about 0.3 V.
