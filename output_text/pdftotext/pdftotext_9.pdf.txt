samples. All the data are presented in Table 1. Survery XPS spectra
of carbonized samples at different temperatures are displayed in
Fig. 3. The mass loss of carbonization in Table 1 is calculated based
on the weight of previous and carbonized PANI. It can be found
that with the temperature increasing from 600 to 1100 ◦ C, the mass
loss increases correspondingly. According to the data of elemental
analysis, we ﬁnd that there is a steady decrease in nitrogen and
hydrogen contents, and an increase in carbon as the temperature
increased, that is consistent with the previous report [32]. The dif-
ference between the data of elemental analysis and XPS is caused
by different test philosophy. However, the variation tendency of
elemental content is the same, i.e., with the temperature increas-
ing from 600 to 1100 ◦ C, the content of carbon goes up. It can be
found that the content of oxygen is relatively low compared to that
of C and N with the temperature increasing from 600 to 850 ◦ C. The
result of above is consistent with elemental analysis.

Fig. 6 gives the cyclic voltammogram of PANI-700 electrode at dif-
ferent sweep rates. Although the voltammograms are not square
and the slopes are present, there is no obvious redox information
which is in accordance with the previous report [11], in which
the presence of pseudo-capacitance in electrode was conﬁrmed in
basic electrolyte, but the mechanism remains unclear. Kawaguchi
et al. [13] think that an asymmetrical rectangle of the CV curve is
due to the reversible pseudo-faradaic reaction. Hulicova et al. [42]
think that this slope is related to the pseudocapacitive properties
of carbonized samples, which should be ascribed to the presence of
incorporated nitrogen in samples. This statement is in accordance
with that deduced from the galvanostatic charge/discharege tests.
In addition, we can discover that the quicker the sweep rate is, the
bigger the responsive current is, which illustrates that the electrode
material has well reversibility.

3.4. Effects of nitrogen in PANI–CNTs on the electrochemical
performances

    The chemical state of nitrogen in PANI carbon nanotubes is
investigated by XPS measurement. Table 2 shows the relative
quantities of surface nitrogen-containing groups and the speciﬁc
surface areas of samples. A typical XPS spectrum of N 1s displays
in Fig. 7. The chemical state of nitrogen atoms in carbonized sam-
ples could be assigned to ﬁve types according to previous reports
[9,11,12,43,44]. These ﬁve types are as following binding ener-
gies: 398.4 eV (pyridine-N-6), 400.5 eV (pyrrole or pyridone-N-5),
401 eV (quaternary-N–Q), 402.6 eV (pyridine-N-oxide or ammo-
nia), 405.5 eV (chemisorbed nitrogen oxides–N–Ox). As seen in
Table 2, the types of nitrogen in samples and the SBET are inﬂuenced
by the heat treatment temperature. As the temperature increasing
from 600 to 850 ◦ C, the speciﬁc surface areas decrease from 253.6
                                                                                           Fig. 7. XPS spectra of N 1s of samples: (I) PANI-600; (II) PANI-700 and (III) PANI-850.
