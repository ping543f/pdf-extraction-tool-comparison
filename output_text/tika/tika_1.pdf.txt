A series of high surface area activated carbon powders modified with various loadings of electroactive
anthraquinone groups was obtained by the spontaneous reduction of the corresponding in situ generated
diazonium derivative on activated carbon. The diazotation and grafting reactions are fast and efficient
and by varying the stoichiometry of these reactions the grafting amount can be controlled. With appro-
priate reaction conditions, the attachment of anthraquinone groups allows to double the capacitance
of the modified carbonaceous material (195 F g−1) compared to the unmodified carbon (100 F g−1) due

charge–discharge cycling experiments were performed for composite electrodes prepared using modi-
fied carbons having two different AQ loadings (e.g. 6.7 and 11.1 wt.%). Following 10 000 charge/discharge
cycles, only a 17% loss of the faradaic capacitance was observed for these two carbons. Thus, this hybrid

. Introduction

In recent years, porous carbon materials have found applications
n electrical energy storage, particularly in electrochemical capac-
tor, an unique device which can store much more energy than a
onventional capacitor that can also offer much higher power den-
ity than batteries and capable of cycling millions of time [1,2].
hese systems are based on the double layer capacitance (DLC) at
he electrode/electrolyte interface where electric charges accumu-
ated by the electrode surface are compensated by electrolyte ionic
pecies of opposite charge.

Activated carbons are promising electrode materials for electri-
al double layer capacitors (EDLCs) because of their relatively low
ost and high specific surface area due to their microporous struc-
ure [4–10]. The relationship between their pore size distribution
nd their electrochemical performances has been widely investi-
ated [2,3]. Until the recent findings on the role of ultramicropores

5], it was believed that mesopores were the most convenient to
rovide high specific capacitance to the carbon materials and sub-
equently to increase their energy density.

Increasing the capacitance by optimization of the pore size dis-
ribution, i.e. with a growing amount of micropores and mesopores

find some limitation due to activated carbon synthesis. Practically,
the useful surface area of activated carbon cannot be enhanced to
an infinite value, which results in a maximum double layer capac-
itance contribution. Other approaches to increase the capacitance
of activated carbon are based on chemical surface modification to
improve the wettability by the electrolyte [6–10] and induce redox
reaction with electrochemically active centers, such as nitrogen,
oxygen or phosphorus surface functional groups [11–15]. Another
attractive way is to add a faradaic contribution to the double
layer capacitance contribution. This can be done by preparing a
multifunctional electrode by mixing a faradaic material with acti-
vated carbon, but usually the faradaic material cannot sustain fast
charge/discharge rates neither long term cycling which is detri-
mental to the performance of the composite electrode compared
to standard activated carbon [16].

The covalent attachment of molecular species to surfaces by
electrochemical and spontaneous reduction of diazonium cations
has been widely investigated in the past two decades [17–26].
Among these, modification with anthraquinone (AQ) groups has
found interest for several applications. Compton and coworkers
introduced and optimized the modification of graphitic or glassy
carbon powder by chemical reduction of 1-diazo-anthraquinone

with H3PO2 [27], and used their material to develop a pH probe
[28]. AQ-modified electrodes were also investigated as electro-
catalysts for the electrochemical reduction of oxygen [29,30] and
also for electrochemical capacitor applications [31,32]. Pickup and
coworkers have reported a 40% increase of capacitance for an elec-

im of this article is to determine the energy storage proper-
ies (e.g. specific capacitance) of several modified carbons from
yclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge experi-
ents in an H2SO4 electrolyte. The cycling rate and long-term

ycling stability of AQ-modified carbon based electrodes were also
nvestigated.

. Experimental

.1. Reagents

Black Pearls 2000 was obtained from the Cabot Corporation
named BP in the following sections), 1-aminoanthraquinone and
ert-butylnitrite (90% solution in acetonitrile) were purchased from
ldrich.

Unless otherwise stated all reagents were obtained from Aldrich
nd were used without further purification. All solutions and subse-
uent dilutions were carried out using deionised water (Barnstead
anopure II).

.2. Carbon modification

In a solution of amino-anthraquinone (AAQ) in degassed ace-
onitrile (for 150 ml of solvent: 192 mg, 0.1 equiv. compared to
arbon) was injected the same quantity of tert-butylnitrite (1 equiv.
ompared to AAQ) after the complete dissolution of the amino
erivative. The mixture was stirred for 30 min and 100 mg of acti-
ated carbon was added. Then, each 30 min, another 1 equiv. of
ert-butylnitrite, was added directly to the organic suspension
hich was kept at ambient temperature while stirring under N2.

ion after the addition of the carbon powder) are summarized in

2.3. Electrode preparation, electrochemical experiments
conditions

The working electrode consists of a composite electrode pre-
pared by mixing, in a small volume of ethanol, the modified
activated carbon and PTFE as binder in a 95:5 wt.% ratio until a
homogenized paste-like consistency was obtained. The paste was
cold rolled and a small square of approximately 0.25 cm2 in size
and 2 mg in weight was placed in a stainless steel grid (80 mesh,
0.127 mm, Alfa Aesar) used as current collector and was pressed for
60 s at 0.9 MPa. A three-electrode configuration was used in a one-
compartment cell for the electrochemical characterization of the
single activated carbon electrode. The counter electrode consists of
a 20 × 60 mm piece of carbon graphite paper placed at 20 mm of
the working electrode with a Ag/AgCl reference electrode placed
at 5 mm of the working electrode. Degazed aqueous sulfuric acid
(0.1 M) was used as electrolyte in all experiments which were per-
formed at room temperature. All potentials are referred to Ag/AgCl
electrode. Prior to any measurement, the working electrode was
dipped in the electrolyte for 20 min in order to allow the electrolyte
to impregnate the electrode porosity.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out using a potentiostat
electrochemical interface SI480 (Solartron Instruments) and the
electrochemical setups were controlled with DC Corrware software
(Scribner Associates, version 2.8d). The gravimetric capacitance C
expressed in farads (F) per gram of paste material (carbon mod-
ified by anthraquinone and PTFE) and the charge induced by
anthraquinone (for the determination of the amount of grafting)
was estimated by voltammetry at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1.

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Electrochemical behavior of the modified carbons

3.1.1. Amount of grafted anthraquinone
Fig. 1 shows the electrochemical response of electrodes made

with the modified carbons that is characterized by a rectangular
shaped cyclic voltammogram (CV) in 0.1 M H2SO4, due to capacitive
behavior of the carbon surface, completed by the reversible redox
waves for the anthraquinone groups centered at about −0.2 V. The
unmodified carbon only shows the rectangular CV. The changes of
the CV following grafting of AQ are similar to those reported for

a carbon fabric electrode (Spectracarb 2225) [33]. The additional
redox waves between 0 and 0.3 V can be tentatively attributed to
the redox processes of the molecules whose oxygen functionali-
ties are involved in hydrogen bonding between two closely-spaced
molecules. Those molecules are oxidized at a more positive poten-

The AQ loading of the electroactive materials are gathered in
able 1 and ranged from 0.8 to 14 wt.%. In this study, the effect of
arious parameters such as the reaction time, amine concentration,
mine/TBN ratio and their concentration on the AQ loading was
nvestigated.

The study of the influence of grafting time (see Table 1, carbons
P1–BP4) revealed that the reaction is very fast and efficient since

t has no considerable effect on the amount of grafted AQ for reac-
ion time longer than 5 min. Similarly, Pickup and coworkers have
hown that the spontaneous reduction of a commercially available
iazonium salt of AQ, Fast red Al Salt (C14H7ClN2O2–0.5ZnCl2) by
he activated carbon Vulcan XC72 in a hypophosporous acid solu-
ion (50 wt.%) yielded a complete grafting after 30 min [34]. They
bserved the same coverage of 6 × 10−5 mol g−1 with reaction time
f either 30 min or 24 h. In this work we have observed that it is
nly by modifying the stoichiometry of the reactions (diazotiza-
ion and grafting) that the amount of grafted AQ can be changed, as
hown in Table 1. Indeed, increasing the amine and the diazotiza-
ion agent concentrations, while keeping the same ratio for the two
eactants, allow to increase the AQ loading (compare samples BP5
nd BP2). Furthermore, the grafting becomes much more efficient
nd increased by a factor close to 2 when the concentration of the
iazotization agent is doubled (BP2 and BP6). Thus, the diazotation
eaction is optimized with an excess of TBN. Furthermore, when
oth the amine and diazotization agent concentrations, as well as
he TBN/amine ratio are increased, a high AQ loading of 14 wt.%

an be achieved. Finally, it is interesting to note that some AQ is
resent at the BP surface even if the diazotization agent is not used.
his could be due to the adsorption of the 1-aminoanthraquinone
olecules at the surface [34] or spontaneous reaction of the amine
ith the carbon [35].

capacitance (C DL) of the modified carbons as a function of the AQ loading. The
dashed curve represents the double layer capacitance relative to the Black Pearls
content of the modified materials.

It is interesting to mention that other approaches have been
tested to influence and increase the amount of grafted molecules
by the diazonium chemistry. For example, Compton and cowork-
ers investigated the role of hypophosphorous acid as the reducing
agent for the covalent derivatization of graphite, carbon nanotubes
and glassy carbon materials [27]. They found that in the absence
of a reducing agent, the derivatization mechanism likely proceeds
via a cationic intermediate, whilst in the presence of hypophospho-
rous acid (in sufficient quantities) the mechanism proceeds through
either a purely radical intermediate. In the presence of the reduc-
ing agent, the surface coverage of AQ groups reaches a maximum
at about 20 ◦C (probably due to the increasing rate of competing
side reactions beyond this temperature) whereas it continues to
increase until 40 ◦C when no hypophosphorous acid is used. Pickup
and coworkers also investigated the effect of the addition of H3PO2
to the reaction mixture and found a 50% decrease of the AQ load-
ing in the presence of this reducing agent [34]. On the other hand,
a preliminary treatment of the carbon surface (e.g. crushing, oxi-
dation by HNO3, heating at 700 ◦C under N2, reduction by NaBH4)
yielded a variation in the amount of the grafted AQ molecules by a
factor of 2 for the resulting modified carbons [32]. A similar obser-
vation has been made for the grafting of 4-nitrobenzene groups on
Vulcan although the variation of the surface coverage was smaller
diazonium cations [22]. Thus, the spontaneous reduction of the
diazonium cation appears generally as a very fast reaction, that is
only slightly influenced by a pretreatment of the carbon material
[22,34] and that the grafting rate appears to be more limited by the
diazonium formation (see Table 1).

The AQ loadings on BP carbons (Table 1) vary over an order of
magnitude and can reach 14 wt.% and compare well with litera-
ture data. It is interesting to note that a 7 to 10 wt.% loading was
achieved on high surface area carbon fabric (Spectracarb 2225) [32].
As expected, for the lower surface area Vulcan which is charac-
terized by a BET surface area of about 225 m2 g−1, a much lower
loading of about 2 wt.% (1 × 10−4 mol g−1) was reached.

3.1.2. Capacitance of the modified carbons

The contribution of the capacitive and faradaic processes to the

total capacitance of the modified carbons were determined from
the cyclic voltammogram (see Section 2) recorded in 0.1 M H2SO4
at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 and are reported in Table 1 and Fig. 2.
Table 1 shows that the double layer capacitance remains relatively

onstant up to a grafting of about 7 wt.%. Further increase of the AQ
oading led to a decrease of the double layer capacitance. Fig. 2 also
hows the variation of the double layer capacitance of the carbon
ubstrate by considering only the fraction of carbon in the modified
aterials. As expected, the evolution of the double layer capaci-

ance is similar albeit the relative decrease is slightly smaller. A
etailed investigation of the effect of AQ grafting on the double

ayer capacitance has been reported elsewhere [36]. Briefly, in the
atter, it has been shown that the covalent attachment of the AQ
roups resulted in a major loss of the microporosity, with pores
maller than 0.65 nm being mainly blocked. The contribution to
he double layer capacitance of these small pores was estimated
o only 0.9 �F cm−2 [36]. This low value can explain why the dou-
le layer capacitance is not strongly affected up to a AQ loading
f 7 wt.%, in agreement with previous studies that have shown that
he capacitance of carbide derived carbons drastically decreased for
alibrated pore size smaller than 0.8 nm [5d]. Interestingly, the con-
ribution of the faradaic process associated to the anthraquinone
edox interconversion increases linearly with the AQ loading in
he range investigated. Thus, the capacitance of the multifunctional
ystem can be significantly increased, as a result of the contribu-
ion of the AQ redox process and to the fact that the double layer
apacitance contribution of the carbon is only slightly affected by
he AQ grafting. Fig. 2 and Table 1 show that the total capacitance
f BP increased from 100 to 195 F g−1 following AQ grafting up to a
oading of 14 wt.%. On the other hand, Pickup and coworkers have
hown that the capacitance of the AQ modified Spectracarb 2225
s 482 F g−1 when averaged between 0 and −0.25 V for an AQ mass
oading of 7 wt.% [32]. This contribution is added to the double layer
apacitance of the carbon fabric, which was 199 F g−1. Thus, the
ontribution of the grafted AQ molecules to the total capacitance
s about 280 F g−1. This is comparable to the enhancement of the
apacitance of 240 F g−1 that could be computed from the data of
able 1 for an AQ-modified BP carbon of 6.7 wt.%, when also average
ver a potential range of 250 mV.

.1.3. Cycling rate
Fig. 3 displays the scan rate dependence of the capacitance (total,

ouble layer and AQ) of various AQ grafted carbon electrodes. As
xpected, the three different capacitances decreased with the scan
ate. Fig. 3(a) demonstrates that the cycling rate of the AQ-BP elec-
rode with an AQ loading of 11.1 wt.% is similar to that of the
nmodified carbon, indicating good kinetics for the redox processes
f the surface bound AQ molecules. The decrease of the total capac-
tance is much more important for the highest AQ loaded electrode

nd at high scan rate, the total capacitance of this electrode even
ecomes smaller than that of the lower (11.1 wt.%) AQ-loaded elec-
rode. This is mainly due to the loss of a significant fraction of the AQ
ignal in the electrochemical window used for the CV experiment,
hich is limited at the negative potential extremity by the forma-

tion of H2. Actually in this case, only the total capacitance can be
reliably evaluated and accordingly the AQ and double layer capaci-
tances are not included in Fig. 3(b and c). Nonetheless, the fact that
for a 14 wt.% loading the capacitance of BP is twice as large relative
to the unmodified carbon at slow scan rate suggests that these high
AQ loaded electrodes could be used for low rate applications.

A close examination of the data of Fig. 3(b and c) revealed some
interesting features. The double layer and AQ capacitances for the
11.1 wt.% loaded BP decreased both monotonously with the scan
rate. This is to be contrasted with the sharp decrease of the double
layer capacitance for the unmodified BP. This has been discussed in
detail elsewhere and is due to the fact that a fraction of the microp-
ores, which contributes to the double layer capacitance, is blocked
by the grafted AQ molecules [36]. As a result, the total capacitance
of the 11.1 wt.% AQ loaded electrode is 1.6 time higher than that
of pristine BP at low scan rate (2 mV s−1), while at faster scan rate
(20 mV s−1) an attractive gain of 100% of the capacitance is observed
and this advantage is kept even at 100 mV s−1. A decrease of the
total capacitance has been also observed for AQ-modified carbon
fabric upon increasing the scan rate but the extent of the decrease
was not mentioned [32].

3.2. Electrochemical stability of the modified carbons

The cycling stability of an electrochemical capacitor is
a key parameter and was investigated by constant current
charge/discharge cycling experiments. These measurements were
performed under relatively low (2 A g−1 of active material) and
high (10 A g−1) rate conditions and Fig. 4(a and b) presents typical
potential–time plots recorded for an AQ-modified carbon electrode
with a 11 wt.% AQ loading. The first charge curve at 2 A g−1 shows a
quasi linear decrease between 0.4 and −0.15 V which corresponds
to the double layer region of the carbon electrode and that is fol-
lowed by a sloped plateau (centered at about 0.2 V) associated to the
reduction of the AQ grafted groups. Following the complete reduc-
tion of the AQ molecules, another short linear region is observed.
During discharge, the reverse processes are occurring with the
observation of the two linear regions and the sloped plateau, which
appears at a slightly more positive potential, in agreement with
the cyclic voltammetry data (Fig. 1). It is worth noting that the AQ
contribution (between −0.3 and −0.5 V) is clearly observed even
at a relatively higher current density of 10 A g−1 (Fig. 4(b)). In addi-
tion, at this higher charge/discharge rate, the shape of the discharge
curve slightly changes with a very fast decrease from 0.5 to 0.1 V
attributed to the resistive character of the electrode. This is fol-

lowed by a linear decrease corresponding to the contribution of
the double layer. At such a high rate, the charge and discharge steps
occur in 11 s and the second double layer contribution observed at
slower rate is not detected because the reduction of AQ groups is
not complete between −0.3 and −0.5 V. These differences observed

ig. 4. Constant current charge/discharge cycles; (a) I = 2 A g−1; (b) I = 10 A g−1; Var
oaded electrodes (charge/discharge cycling experiments performed at I = 10 A g−1).

t these two cycling rates are in agreement with the CV data (vide
upra).

The evolution of the capacitance (total, double layer and AQ) of
P modified with two different loadings of AQ during 10 000 con-
tant current charge/discharge cycles is shown in Fig. 4(c and d).
decrease of the total capacitance is noticed during the first 2000

ycles and is mainly due to the loss of the AQ redox waves as the
ouble layer capacitance contribution is barely affected. This phe-
omenon is amplified when the AQ loading is increased. During the
ubsequent cycles, the decrease is much less important and after
0 000 charge/discharge cycles, both electrodes lost approximately
7% of their faradaic capacitance (Fig. 4(c and d)). Since the grafting

oadings are different, this loss translates in total capacitance fade
f 10 and 14% for 6.7 and 11 wt.% AQ-loaded electrodes, respec-
ively. It is interesting to note that AQ is affected in a similar way,
ndependently of the AQ loading. After the initial capacitance loss
bserved during the first 2000 cycles, the fade appears to be approx-
mately the same, independently of the grafting amount (1.3% of the
Q capacitance per 1000 charge/discharge cycles for the two elec-

rodes with a current density of 10 A g−1). By assuming that the rate
f the loss will remain constant upon further cycling, the lifetime
f such modified electrodes (before its capacitance has attained the
nitial value, i.e. the one for the pristine carbon) could be estimated
o about 84 000 cycles.

Even if both electrodes still exhibit higher capacitance compared
o the pristine carbon electrode even after 10 000 cycles, it is rel-
vant to understand the cause of the loss of the AQ redox waves
ecause the decrease of the performance of the AQ-modified BP
lectrode is mainly due to the organic molecules. Firstly, the ini-

ial decrease of capacitance observed during the first 2000 cycles
an be due to the loss of AQ species that are only physisorbed to
he carbon surface. In a recent study, it has been clearly demon-
trated that adsorbed species can account for at least 50% of the
pecies immobilized at the surface of carbon powder [34]. These
of the total, AQ and double layer capacitances for: (c) 6.7 wt.% and (d) 11 wt.% AQ

adsorbed AQ moieties can be effectively removed by washing with
benzene. In our work, the washing method that was used to extract
the adsorbed molecules consisted of using several liters of different
organic solvents (acetonitrile, DMF, acetone and methanol) until
complete decoloration of the filtrate. At the beginning of the wash-
ing procedure, the filtrate was dark brown, especially with DMF. At
the end, a final washing with DMF by sonication for 30 min yielded
a colorless solvent. Thus, we believe that this procedure is efficient
to dissolve most of the absorbed AQ molecules. Secondly, degrada-
tion of the AQ molecules might also occur. This can be demonstrated
by cycling experiments performed at a lower scan rate. For exam-
ple, the decrease of AQ capacitance when the cycling was carried
out at 2 A g−1 (instead of 10 A g−1 in Fig. 4(c and d)), is higher and
reaches 55%. As a result the total capacitance will decrease by about
30%. The pronounced loss of capacitance at slower rate can be
explained by the fact that in this case the electrodes stay longer
at the extreme potential values, which is presumably harmful for
the grafted organic species.

These results suggest that AQ grafting is an interesting approach
to improve the capacitance of a carbon electrode. However, the
stability of the grafted AQ molecules will have to be improved.
Furthermore, to develop a more advanced two-electrode elec-
trochemical capacitor, a similar grafting could be performed to
increase the capacitance of the positive electrode. This could be
achieved by selecting an appropriate molecule that is characterized
by a more positive redox potential.

4. Conclusion
The specific capacitance of a high surface area activated carbon
was doubled by grafting AQ groups at its surface. With such car-
bon good performances are maintained during long-term cycling
and high current density charge–discharge cycling. However, the
grafted carbon exhibits a progressive loss of the electroactivity

aterials are going to be used in practical electrochemical capaci-

ors. Nevertheless, AQ grafted activated carbon opens the way for
he design of improved electrodes for electrochemical energy stor-
ge devices. Future work will aim at finding an equivalent to AQ
or the positive carbon electrode in order to improve the overall
apacitance of the device.
