The stability of electrochemical double layer capacitors (EDLC) utilizing an ionic liquid and tetraethy-
lammoninium tetrafluoroborate (TEABF4) in acetonitrile electrolyte was tested by cycling and by constant
voltage hold tests. It turned out that possible degradation of the EDLC is visible in the voltage hold test
after a time period which is typically much shorter if compared to the cycle tests. A constant capacitance
during several thousands of cycles does not necessarily indicate stability. For capacitor cells using
a carbon black as active material and an ionic liquid as electrolyte constant capacitance could be
demonstrated over 12,000 cycles between 0 V and 3.75 V. Clear ageing was observed, however, during
the voltage hold test at 3.75 V after 300 h. For a maximum voltage of 3.5 V both the cycle and the voltage
hold test indicated stable performance over 12,000 cycles or 500 h, respectively. For capacitors using an
activated carbon as active material and standard electrolyte TEABF4 in acetonitrile both tests clearly
demonstrated degradation for a maximum cell voltage of 3.5 V. The evolution of capacitance loss
observed for the voltage hold test at 3.25 V is in good agreement with the degradation observed at 3.5 V
for the voltage hold test.

1. Introduction

Electrochemical double layer capacitors (EDLC) are known for
their high power density and cycle stability. Commercial products
provide a cycle life of one million or above at nominal conditions,
which correspond to cycling between 0 V and the nominal cell
voltage at room temperature. The end of life criterion is 20% or 30%
loss in capacitance or doubling of the internal resistance [1].

In most of the scientific literature the stability of a newly
developed EDLC material or EDLC system is demonstrated via
cycling and typically several thousands of cycles are presented
without significant capacitance loss [2,3]. However, apart from the
fact that accumulation of several thousand cycles is already rather

time consuming, the question arises, if several thousand cycles are
really sufficient to proof the life time stability of a device over
several hundred thousand cycles or even one million?

An alternative to the cycling test is the constant load or float test
performed by holding the capacitor at the nominal cell voltage and
determining the capacitance as a function of time by occasional
charge/discharge cycles [4,5]. Like cycle tests, whichmay reflect the
duty cycle for some applications of EDLC, voltage hold experiments
directly reflect conditions for those applications where the capac-
itor is an emergency or backup device being permanently charged
and waiting for the emergency event to occur.

The significant difference between these two test procedures
and the respective cycle-rating and float-rating of a capacitor was
already pointed out by M. Okamura et al. [6], who stated that
during cycling only a “derated” voltage is applied to the capacitor
increasing the measured life time. In the present communication
we will compare both test procedures and discuss advantages and

disadvantages of one or the other. Although we assume that our
conclusions drawn from tests performed with laboratory scale cells
also hold for commercial cells it cannot be excluded that certain
differences will occur.

2. Experimental

2.1. Materials

For preparation of the electrodes two high surface area carbons
(YP17 (Kuraray Chemicals Japan) and an experimental carbon black
(Timcal, Switzerland)) were used for standard electrolyte and ionic
liquid, respectively. Both carbons were used as received. Electrodes
were prepared by mixing 90 wt. % of carbon material together with
10wt. % of Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) binder (60% dispersion in
water, Sigma Aldrich). The two components were dispersed in
a mixture of isopropanol:water 1:1, heated up to 100 �C and
constantly stirred until a dough like mass was achieved. Afterwards
self-standing electrodes were prepared out of the two different
carbon materials. The thickness of the YP17 electrodes is in the
range of 200 mm, whereas the thickness of the carbon black elec-
trodes was increased to approximately 500 mm to improve the
mechanical stability. The electrode sheets were dried for at least
24 h at 120 �C and a vacuum of 20 mbar before they were assem-
bled in capacitor cells.

Prior to use the ionic liquid [EMIM][BF4] (purity > 98%, Merck
KGaA Darmstadt) was dried in a Schlenck tube at 100 �C and
a vacuum of 2 � 10�3 mbar for at least 8 h. The standard electro-
lytes, i.e. 1 M tetraethylammoninium tetrafluoroborate (TEABF4) in
acetonitrile (AN) (Honeywell speciality chemicals Seelze, Germany)
was used as received. Karl Fischer titration (KF Coulometer 684,
Metrohm, Switzerland) showed for all electrolytes water contents
below 20 ppm.

2.2. Electrochemistry

The assembly and filling of the electrochemical cells were
described before [4]. In brief, the activated carbon/carbon black
electrodes (diameter 12 mm) are sandwiched between two spring
loaded (50 Ncm2) titanium pistons. A carbon coated aluminium
layer (Gaia Akkumulatorenwerke, Germany) was put in between
titanium and electrode for better contact. The two electrodes were
separated using a 30 mm thick paper separator (Maxwell Technol-
ogies, Switzerland) or a glass fibre separator (EUJ116 from Hol-
lingsworth & Vose, UK) for standard electrolyte and ionic liquid,
respectively. Before each test the cells were dried at 120 �C under
vacuum for at least 12 h. The cells were vacuum filled using
a syringe connected with a tube to the cell body inside a glovebox
with O2 and H2O contents below 1 ppm (MBraun, Germany).

For the cycling tests a specific current was applied for cycling the
full cell between the critical upper voltage and 0 V. In the case of the
ionic liquid/carbon black cells a specific current of 0.75 Ag�1 was
applied. The cells with standard electrolyte/YP17 activated carbon
were cycled with 1 Ag�1. The specific current refers to the mass
of both electrodes. The respective capacitance was evaluated from
the current and time for discharge, typically each 300 cycles.
The available cell voltage was determined considering the IR drop
(after approx. 3e4 s) of the cell.

The voltage hold test procedure has been described in detail
elsewhere [4]. In brief, the critical voltage was applied to the cell
and by occasional cycling the cell between 2.5 V and 0 V with
a constant current of 0.28 Ag�1 the respective capacitance was
determined. Three cycles were applied every 10 h during the
voltage hold procedure. An upper voltage of 2.5 Vwas considered to
be harmless for the cell.
Cycle tests with standard electrolyte/YP17 electrodes were
performed with a programmable potentiostat (VMP 3 workstation,
Biologic France). The cycle and voltage hold tests with ionic liquid
were performed using a CCCC Battery cycler (Astrol Technologies,
Switzerland). All tests were performed at room temperature
without temperature control.

3. Results and discussion

In order to increase energy and power density of EDLCs the cell
voltage should be increased above the typical 2.5e2.8 V of currently
available EDLC utilizing activated carbon and TEABF4 in acetonitrile.
Novel electrolytes such as ionic liquids [7,8] or novel carbons such
as carbon nanotubes [9,10] or graphene [11,12] or combinations of
such [13,14] were suggested to allow for an increased cell voltage
without loss in power and stability. The preservation of stability is
usually demonstrated by cycling experiments over several tens of
thousand cycles between the critical cell voltage and zero voltage.
Cycling experiments are relatively easy to set up, but are rather
time consuming; especially when considering that 500,000 to
1,000,000 cycles are commonly required for commercial products
before a capacitance loss of 30% is observed. Demonstrated 20,000
cycles, therefore, just cover 2e4% of the aimed cycle life.

For example, for the asymmetric EDLC system utilizing pyrro-
lidinium based ionic liquids as electrolytes at temperatures of 60 �C
a potential window of 4.0 V was demonstrated by Mastragostino
[15] by cycling. About 20,000 cycles at a rate of 1 Ag�1 were ob-
tained before 20% of the initial capacitance was lost.

Charge/discharge cycle experiments are typically used for
batteries to demonstrate stability. Batteries are usually prone to
degradation at the upper as well as at the lower voltage limit. Even
at intermediate voltages batteries may suffer from charge transfer
reactions occurring in the bulk of the electrode materials. In
contrast, EDLCs are accepted to be very stable at voltages below the
nominal cell voltage and can be discharged to zero without harm.

As a consequence, during cycling experiments between the fully
charged state and the discharged state the capacitor is most of the
time exposed to voltages, which are known not to affect the
stability. In order to avoid this waste of cycling timewe suggest that
the alternative constant hold test (or constant voltage hold test or
float test) is much more efficient for determination of the EDLCs
stability limits. This situation is sketched in Fig. 1 where for both
tests voltage and current are plotted. The solid (blue) line repre-
sents the cycle test while the dotted (red) line shows current
(bottom) and voltage (top) versus time for the hold test. The grey
areas (Fig.1, top) clearly show that the time the capacitor is exposed
to voltages above an assumed stability limit is small for the
cycle test. For the hold test, the capacitor is constantly exposed to
voltages above the assumed stability limit. Another fundamental
difference between the two tests reveals the current developing
(Fig. 1, bottom). The cycling test is performed at an arbitrarily set
and constant current. During the voltage hold test the recorded
current corresponds to the leakage current, which decreases
constantly during the test period [16].

In order to compare both ageing test procedures we measured
the capacitance decrease for a capacitor cell utilizing [EMIM][BF4]
and carbon black electrodes. The upper potential limits were set to
3.75 V and 3.5 V. The cycling test was performed by cycling
between 0 V and the respective upper cell voltage at a specific
current of 0.75 Ag�1. With this specific current one complete
cycle takes 300 s. In parallel voltage hold tests at 3.75 V and 3.5 V
were performed according to the procedure described in the
experimental part and in the publication by Ruch et al. [4].

The results of the cycling tests are reproduced in Fig. 2a and b for
the ionic liquid [EMIM][BF4].

Even though both cycling experiments (Fig. 2a) up to 12,000
cycles indicate no significant capacitance loss independent of the
upper voltage limit some capacitance fluctuations could be
observed. While for a voltage of 3.5 V the capacitance goes
through a minimum around 5000 cycles for a voltage of 3.75 V
a maximum is observed. The origin of these fluctuations is not
clear and may be related to temperature changes. In order to
detect any changes of the performance during the cycling tests we
also compared the charge/discharge voltage profiles at the
beginning and the end of the cycling tests as reproduced in
Fig. 2b. While for a voltage limit of 3.5 V initial and final cycles
show an identical profile, differences can be detected for the
voltage limit of 3.75 V. However, no capacitance decrease is
observed and therefore such differences cannot be taken as a clear
indication of ageing.

The respective voltage hold experiments (Fig. 3) show a clear
difference between the test performed at 3.75 V (red dots) and at
3.5 V (green squares). A decrease of the capacitance is already
observed after 200 h of test at 3.75 V. The capacitance loss of 30% is
observed after 340 h. The voltage hold test at 3.5 V, however,
indicates stable performance and no significant capacitance loss is
observed after 500 h. The results of the cycling tests would suggest
a stable system at both voltages, the result for the voltage hold tests
differs significantly for the two voltages and shows that the system
is clearly not stable at 3.75 V.

Assuming that the stability limit of the above system is 3.5 V, the
voltage of the capacitor was for only 8% of the test time above the
critical value of 3.5 V for the cycling test performed at 3.75 V. With
a current density of 0.75 Ag�1 one cycle takes about 300 s. Thus the
cycling test time for Fig. 2a was for both vertex voltages above
1000 h for more than 12,000 cycles. During this time the capacitor
was exposed to the critical voltages of 3.5 V and above for only 80 h
in Fig. 2a. However, the respective constant voltage hold test
showed clear degradation only after about 300 h. As a consequence

the cycle test with 12,000 cycles was too short to detect degrada-
tion. Vice versa, the constant voltage hold test in Fig. 3b corre-
sponds to more than 75,000 cycles when considering only the time
the capacitors is exposed to voltages beyond the stability limit of
3.5 V in the cycle test.

In the above example the difference between the upper voltage
limit (3.75 V) during cycling and the stability limit (3.5 V) was
relatively small and therefore only the voltage hold test clearly
indicated the stability limit of 3.5 V. If the upper voltage limit is set
significantly higher than the accepted stability limit the capaci-
tance loss will also be clearly identifiable by means of a cycle test,
but the advantage of the hold test is still maintained. This is
demonstrated in the following by means of hold-and cycling
experiments at an upper stability limit of 3.5 V using a TEABF4
based electrolyte as this cell voltage is definitively higher than the
accepted nominal voltage of commercial devices using activated
carbon and TEABF4 in acetonitrile (AN).

Fig. 4 shows the results of the voltage hold test and the
cycling test for such devices at 3.5 V. The results of the hold and
cycle tests are plotted in one figure as function of the real test
time.

For a device utilizing the standard electrolyte with AN both
tests (cycle and hold) confirm that a cell voltage of 3.5 V is above
the stability limit. However, for the constant voltage hold test
a capacitance loss of 30% occurs already after 30 h. For the cycle test
300 h are needed for observing the same capacitance loss.

From the above discussion and results it is obvious that the
constant voltage hold test is much more time efficient than
a cycling test. The main reason is the fact that during the hold test
the capacitor is constantly exposed to the maximum (nominal)
voltage while during cycling the capacitor is exposed to a “derated”
voltage [6] only (see Fig. 1). As a consequence Okamura et al. [6]
suggested to distinguish between capacitor rating determined
by hold experiments and by cycling. The rating for capacitors
determined by cycling was suggested to be about 0.3 V higher than
the rating found by hold experiments.

The rule suggested by Okamura et al. [6] is nicely confirmed in
Fig. 5 where the results of the cycling test at 3.50 V are compared to
the results of a hold test performed at 3.25 V previously published
[4]. Now the actual test time until a loss of 30% is reached is almost
equal, namely 300 h for the hold test and 350 h for the cycle test.

of a full capacitor cell utilizing an activated carbon YP17 and 1 M TEABF4 in acetonitrile.
Hold voltage and upper voltage limit during cycling is 3.5 V. Lower voltage limit during
cycling 0.0 V. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the

Realistic and meaningful cycling tests should be performed at
currents adapted to the use of capacitors, that is at relative high
currents of typically 2 Ag�1 and above, in order to monitor possible
degradation due to stress and fatigue caused by the alternating
charge discharge processes. The length of one charge/discharge
cycle should be in the order of seconds. In many of the published
investigations, however, cycling tests are performed at relatively
low specific current and cycle times are typically in the range of
minutes corresponding to a rather gentle use.

Cycling tests are performed at relatively low currents mainly in
order to keep the IR voltage drop low. The equivalent series resis-
tance (ESR) of small laboratory scale test cells is typically large
compared to the ESR of a commercial cell optimized for high power.
If a cycling test is performed at realistic high currents a large IR drop
may be encountered in a laboratory scale cell which is added to the
real cell voltage. This effect makes the cycle test even more ineffi-
cient, because the upper cell voltage is the sum of real voltage plus
IR, which means that the maximum real cell voltage is lowered or
degraded even further. In addition, the internal resistance of the
tested cell may increase during the cycle test, which eventually
results in a significant reduction of the applied electrode potentials
in the cell, untruly pretending a stable behaviour.
4. Conclusion

- We have confirmed that constant voltage hold tests are more
demanding than respective cycling tests with identical upper
voltage limits. Typically the cycling test takes longer than the
voltage hold test before a clear result can be defined.

- During the cycling test most of the time is consumed at
capacitor voltages, which are not critical for the capacitor’s
stability. The time spent above the critical voltage limit is
proportional to the number of cycles and inversely proportional
to the applied specific current.

- EDLCs utilizing [EMIM][BF4] and carbon black are stable at
a cell voltage of 3.5 V at room temperature.
