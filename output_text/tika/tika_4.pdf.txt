Supercapacitor electrodes and devices that utilise conducting polymers are envisaged to bridge the
gap between existing carbon-based supercapacitors and batteries to form units of intermediate specific
energy. This review looks at the major conducting polymer materials, namely, polyaniline, polypyrrole,
polythiophene and derivatives of polythiophene, as well as composites of these materials with carbon
nanotubes and inorganic battery materials. Various treatments of the conducting polymer materials to
improve their properties are considered and comparisons are made with other supercapacitor materials
such as carbon and with inorganic battery materials. Conducting polymers are pseudo-capacitive mate-
rials, which means that the bulk of the material undergoes a fast redox reaction to provide the capacitive

response and they exhibit superior specific energies to the carbon-based supercapacitors (double-layer
capacitors). In general conducting polymers are more conductive than the inorganic battery materials
and consequently have greater power capability. On the downside, conducting polymers swell and con-
tract substantially on charge and discharge, respectively. Consequently, cycle-life is poor compared with
carbon-based supercapacitors which generally only charge via adsorption and desorption of ions (giving
typically a few thousand cycles for conducting polymers compared with >500 000 cycles for carbon-based

devices).

arket both in hybrid electric vehicles and pure electric vehicles to
mprove regenerative braking (through fast charge capability) and
eliver larger acceleration (through fast discharge capability). Tra-
itionally, capacitors have been constructed using a set of parallel
onducting plates separated by an insulator. Capacitive charge of
pposite sign builds up on the respective plates in response to a
oltage difference between them. The capacitances are delivered
n mF and �F quantities [1]. In more recent times, capacitors have
een developed that give hundreds to thousands of Farads and
hese are usually known as supercapacitors, or ultracapacitors, and
ere initially constructed from carbons of high surface area [2].

hese are in fact two capacitors connected in series with a con-
ucting liquid media linking them. Such a supercapacitor device
erives its performance from a so-called double-layer capacitance
nd is therefore often referred to as an (electric or) electrochemical
ouble-layer capacitor (EDLC). The capacitance in these devices is
tored as a build up of charge in the electrical double-layer in the
olution interface close to the surface of the carbon to balance the
harge in the carbon material.

Another type of supercapacitor, referred to as a pseudo-
apacitor, derives its capacitance from the storage of charge in the
ulk of a redox material in response to a redox reaction. This fast
edox reaction [3–5] acts like capacitance (hence the name pseudo-
apacitance). A pseudo-capacitor typically stores a greater amount
f capacitance per gram than an EDLC, as the bulk of the material
not just the surface layer) reacts. On the other hand, an EDLC has
aster kinetics as only the surface of the carbon is being accessed.
n example of a pseudo-capacitive material is a conducting poly-
er (CP) (the conductivity of which was first reported in 1963 by
eiss and co-workers in Australia [6–8] and first utilised in super-

apacitors in the mid 1990s [4]) and it is this material that will
e the subject of this review. The review will focus on work done
ost-2000 but for a comprehensive description of work pre-2000
eaders should consult Ref. [9]. The concept of ‘bridging the gap’
ith batteries to form conducting-polymer-based supercapacitors
ith superior specific energy compared with carbon-based alter-
atives is illustrated in Fig. 1.

Conducting polymers are rendered conductive through a conju-
ated bond system along the polymer backbone. They are typically
ormed either through chemical oxidation of the monomer (for
xample with iron chloride) [5] or electrochemical oxidation of
he monomer. Two oxidation reactions occur simultaneously – the
xidation of the monomer and the oxidation of the polymer [10]
ith the coincident insertion of a dopant/counter ion (e.g. Cl−).

he dopant or doping level (in this p-type conducting polymer) is
ypically below 1 dopant per polymer unit: approximately 0.3–0.5,
.e., 2–3 monomer units per dopant. This is limited by how closely
he positive charges (so-called polarons) can be spaced along the
olymer chain. The polymers that are most commonly studied
or use in supercapacitor devices are polypyrrole, polyaniline, and

erivatives of polythiophene [11]. The typical dopant level for these
olymers, as well as their typical specific capacitances and voltage
anges, are given in Table 1.

The difference between EDLCs and conducting-polymer-based
upercapacitors is shown schematically in Fig. 2. In general, carbon-

based supercapacitors have high power capabilities, due to the fast
sorption and desorption of ions, but a low specific energy [13].
Conducting polymers should improve the device as they undergo
a redox reaction to store charge in the bulk of the material and
thereby increase the energy stored and reduce self-discharge. One
significant drawback of these materials is the relatively low power
(or lower rate of charge–discharge) due to the slow diffusion of ions
within the bulk of the electrode. Nevertheless, it is still proposed
that conducting polymers can bridge the gap between batteries
and double-layer supercapacitors as these electrodes have bet-
ter kinetics than nearly all inorganic battery electrode materials
(pseudo-capacitive materials) [13].

Conducting polymers are generally attractive as they have high
charge density and low cost (compared with the relatively expen-
sive metal oxides) [14,15]. It is possible to develop devices with
low equivalent series resistance (ESR), high power, and high energy
[16]. Polyaniline can exhibit a charge density of 140 mAh g−1,
which is slightly lower than that obtained with expensive metal
oxides such as LiCoO2 [17,18] but much higher than that given by
carbon devices that often deliver less than 15 mAh g−1 (perhaps
∼40 mAh g−1 for the individual electrode) [14]. Carbon–carbon
symmetric supercapacitor devices can achieve a specific power of

−1 −1
3–4 kW kg and a specific energy of 3–5 Wh kg when fully pack-
aged [13,19,20], while a conducting polymer supercapacitor, based
on polyaniline, can achieve a slightly lower power at 2 kW kg−1 but
double the specific energy (10 Wh kg−1) [19]. As will be discussed
in Section 3, the weight used for the calculation of specific energy

nd power is often not specified. That is whether it is the weight of
evice, packaged device, electrode or active material. This makes
omparison of different supercapacitor performances difficult.

Double-layer capacitors are highly cycleable, namely, >0.5 mil-
ion cycles [2] whereas conducting polymer pseudo-capacitors
ften begin to degrade under less than a thousand cycles
ue to changes in their physical structure that are caused by
he doping/de-doping (intercalation/deintercalation) of ions [19].
igher specific energies may be achieved with conducting poly-
er electrodes by increasing the doping level. This comes at a cost,

ue to a larger degree of counter ion insertion and de-insertion
ith an accompanying volume change [21]. This volume change,

r swelling, causes mechanical failure of the electrode under pro-
onged cycling. Interestingly, results using conducting polymer
lectrodes with electrolytes based on ionic liquids [22,23] show
hat the electrodes perform better with greater life times, espe-

ially in actuators [24] where doping and undoping of ions into
he polymer is required for the shape changes. The preparation of
oth conducting polymer electrodes and devices with ionic liquid
lectrolytes will be discussed later in more detail.

Conducting polymers are attractive because they have good
intrinsic conductivity, namely, from a few S cm−1 to 500 S cm−1 in
the doped state [5,25] as can be seen in Table 2. Conducting poly-
mers have low band-gaps (1–3 eV) compared with conventional
polymers (10 eV) [5]. They have relatively fast charge–discharge
kinetics, suitable morphology, and fast doping and undoping pro-
cesses [29]. Conducting polymers also have plastic properties [25]
and are therefore easily manufactured, particularly as thin films.

Conducting polymers can be p-doped with (counter) anions
when oxidised and n-doped with (counter) cations when reduced.
The simplified equations for these two charging processes are as
follows:

Cp → Cpn+(A−)n + ne− (p-doping) (1)
Cp + ne− → (C+)nCpn− (n-doping) (2)
The discharge reactions are, of course, the reverse of the above
equations. Complications can occur given that on oxidation a cer-
tain degree of cation inclusion (mixed doping) is possible under
certain circumstances. Examples of p- and n-dopable thiophene-
based conducting polymers are listed in Table 3, along with the
voltage ranges in which these processes occur.

Supercapacitor devices made solely from conducting polymers
can have three configurations [27,30–33]:

Type I (symmetric) using the same p-dopable polymer for both
electrodes.
Type II (asymmetric) using two different p-dopable polymers with
a different range of electroactivity.
Type III (symmetric) using the same polymer for both electrodes
with the p-doped form used as the positive electrode and the n-
doped form used as the negative electrode.

In addition, asymmetric (or hybrid) devices using a conducting
polymer positive electrode and carbon or lithium-based negative
electrode can be constructed [20,21,29,34].

A Type III device based entirely on conducting polymers is the
most attractive. Theoretically, it should be highly conductive in
the charged state as both electrodes will be doped (i.e. the nega-
tive is n-doped and the positive is p-doped) [14]. In addition the
charge is released at higher potentials (up to at least 3 V) com-
pared with Type I and Type II devices [14,21]. This higher potential
range should result in high specific energy and power due to the
mer supercapacitor devices do not perform as well as expected due
to the difficulty of the n-doping process.

Early studies of n-doped materials were performed on poly-
acetylene (Fig. 3a–b) and later poly-p-phenylene [14] (Fig. 3c).

hese polymers have high impedances upon n-doping and are
herefore not suitable for use as negative electrodes. Many con-
ucting polymers, such as polyaniline and polypyrrole, can only be
-doped due to the very negative potentials required for n-doping,
hen compared with the reduction potential limit of molecular

olvent-based electrolytes [35]. A purified electrolyte or a room-
emperature ionic liquid [36] with a wide electrochemical window,
articularly at negative potentials, is required for n-doping [4].
n example of a promising n-dopable material is polythiophene
nd its derivatives. Polythiophene itself is not n-dopable in ace-
onitrile [14] as the potential for n-doping is more negative than

he breakdown potential of the solvent at below −2.0 V vs. Ag|Ag+
37,38]. Substitution at the 3-position with an aryl group results
n more positive n-doping potentials. These polymers are not very

have a low capacitance in this potential region. Consequently,
they are usually only employed as the positive electrode with a
negative electrode made from another material such as carbon
[21,29].

The properties of conducting polymers can be greatly enhanced
by forming composites between the conducting polymer and other
materials such as carbon (including carbon nanotubes) [39], inor-
ganic oxides and hydroxides [40,41], and other metal compounds
[42–44]. Examples of some of these composites and their electro-
chemical properties are given in Table 4. These electrodes can allow
the device to be made symmetric (Type I or Type III) with the same

positive and negative electrode. The composite materials have
improved conductivity (particularly at the more negative/reducing
potentials) and better cycleability, mechanical stability, specific
capacitance and processability [5].

. Discussion

The three main methods used for determining the capaci-
ance of conducting polymer materials are illustrated in Fig. 4,
amely, constant-current charge–discharge, cyclic voltammetry
CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Ideally,
he charge–discharge curve for a capacitor should be linear with
slope equal to the current divided by the capacitance. Calculation
f capacitance from this data is given in Fig. 4a. In the absence of
edox processes, the cyclic voltammogram of a capacitor should be
ectangular with the capacitance roughly equal to half the value
f the difference in plateau currents divided by the scan rate, see
ig. 4b. Finally, the low-frequency components of EIS data repre-
ent the capacitive region and a plot such as Fig. 4c can be used
o determine the capacitance. There are, however, other ways of
xtracting capacitance from EIS measurements, e.g., modelling the
ata with equivalent circuits.

.1. Polyaniline

Polyaniline has been studied extensively as a supercapacitor
r battery electrode material [11,15,19,27,42,44,49,50,53,55–68].
he structure of polyaniline is illustrated in Fig. 3d. Polyaniline has
any desirable properties for use in a supercapacitor device; it has

igh electroactivity, a high doping level (0.5 – see Table 1), excel-
ent stability and a high specific capacitance (400–500 F g−1 in an
cidic medium) [19]. In addition, it has good environmental sta-
ility, controllable electrical conductivity (around 0.1 S cm−1 in the
oped state with a Li dopant, but can range from around 0.1 to
S cm−1 as shown in Table 2), and can be easily processed [15,27].

major disadvantage of polyaniline is that it requires a proton to

e properly charged and discharged; therefore a protic solvent, an
cidic solution or a protic ionic liquid is required [58].

Polyaniline has been reported to have a wide capacity range
rom 44 to 270 mAh g−1 [11]. This variation in capacity is related to
Et4NBF4 in PC, LiPF6 in EC/DMC [29]

e, MWNT is multiwalled carbon nanotube, RuOx is ruthenium oxide and MSP-20 is

many factors, including synthetic route used, polymer morphology,
the amount and type of binders and additives, and the thickness of
the electrode. Polyaniline has the most variable specific capacitance
of all conducting polymers; the specific capacitance achievable is
higher for electrodeposited than for chemically formed polyaniline.

It has been reported [27] that the cycle-life of polyaniline for a
Li-doped positive electrode was over 5000 cycles, during which the
specific capacitance dropped from 100 to 70 F g−1. In another study
[15], polyaniline doped with LiPF6 achieved a specific capacitance
of 107 F g−1 that decreased to 84 F g−1 after 9000 cycles.

A device has been constructed with polyaniline as the positive
electrode and carbon as the negative [21], i.e., a so-called hybrid
electrochemical capacitor. According to Park and Park [21] their
device gives similar or higher values than recently reported Type III
supercapacitors made from polythiophene derivatives. A constant-
current charge–discharge (0.5 mA cm−2) test yields 380 F g−1, a
specific energy of 18 Wh kg−1 and a specific power of 1.25 kW kg−1

(at 20 mA cm−2). Using cyclic voltammetry, a cycle-life of 4000
cycles was observed. The device charges between 1.25 and 1.5 V
and discharges between 1.4 and 1.0 V.

Polyaniline can be modified to make it more stable by forming
poly(n-methyl aniline) (Fig. 3e) [11]. In this polymer, the proton
exchange sites are blocked by the methyl groups, so that the poly-
mer is stabilised against chemical degradation and made more
redox active. A combination of this conducting polymer with a
lithium negative electrode can achieve a capacity of 52 mAh g−1.

2.2. Polypyrrole

Polypyrrole offers a greater degree of flexibility in elec-
trochemical processing than most conducting polymers
[69], and consequently the material has been the subject
of much research as a supercapacitor or battery electrode
[3,12,31,45–47,51,52,55,70–85]. On the downside, polypyrrole
(Fig. 3f) cannot be n-doped like the thiophene derivatives, and thus
it has only found use as a cathode material.

Due its greater density, polypyrrole has a high capacitance per

unit volume (400–500 F cm−3) [86]. One disadvantageous aspect of
the dense growth is that it leads to limited access to the interior sites
of the polymer for dopant ions. This reduces the capacitance per
gram, especially for thicker coatings on electrodes [87]. Polypyr-
role is typically doped with single-charged anions such as Cl−,

lO4− and SO3− but if doped with multiple-charged anions, e.g.
O42−, physical crosslinking of the polymer occurs [10]. Accord-
ng to Suematsu et al. [10], the cross-linked materials have high
iffusivity and higher capacitance, presumably due to the greater
orosity of the growth. Suematsu et al. [10] do not back up this
tatement by quoting the specific capacitance of the material;
nly capacitance per unit volume of material is quoted and is
ower (100–200 F cm−3) than typically denser polypyrrole layers
400–500 F cm−3), as expected.

Combining polypyrrole with polyimide (a dopant of high molec-
lar weight) is claimed to improve the charge storage properties
81], due to the polyimide matrix protecting the polypyrrole from
xidative degradation and the polyimide is cathodically electroac-
ive (whereas polypyrrole is anodically electroactive). Polyimide

as excellent thermal stability and very good mechanical proper-
ies. No details as to how the material performed as a supercapacitor
lectrode were given, except for EIS data that was used to exam-
ne the capacitive behaviour. Polyimide is generally considered an
nsulative material which may result in poor performance.
r Sources 196 (2011) 1–12

Polypyrrole has been used as an electrode to make a Type
I supercapacitor, as well as combined with poly(3-methyl thio-
phene) or PMeT to form a Type II version [31]. The Type I device has
a discharge capacitance of 8–15 mF cm−2, which is similar to that
for the Type II device. The voltage range is around 0.5–1.0 V for the
Type I device, but is extended to 1.2 V for the Type II. Polypyrrole has
also been used to fabricate an all solid-state-supercapacitor with a
PVA-based polymer electrolyte [88]. The design gave up to 84 F g−1

[88] with a stable capacitance after 1000 cycles, and delivered a
specific energy of 12 Wh kg−1.

2.3. Thiophene-based conducting polymers

A range of n-dopable thiophene (Fig. 3g) based conducting poly-
mers is given in Table 3. The mass specific capacitance in the
n-doped form is, in general, lower than that of the p-doped form. It
is also found, in general, that the conductivity in the n-doped form
is poor. This limits the use of these materials in the n-doped form as
an anode material. Most polythiophene derivatives are stable in air
and moisture in both the p-doped and undoped forms [5]. Accord-
ing to Ryu et al. [29] and Villers et al. [30], Type III devices made
from polythiophene derivatives should achieve 30–40 Wh kg−1 and
5–10 kW kg−1 per active material mass. An example of this type of
symmetric supercapacitor is made from poly(ditheno(3,4-b:3′,4′d)
thiophene) (PDTT) [89,90]; a p-doped PDTT electrode had a capac-
itance of 106.4 mF cm−2 while a n-doped PDTT electrode exhibited
a capacitance of 43.2 mF cm−2 [89].

Polythiophene is n-doped at very low potentials (below −2.0 V
vs. Ag|Ag+) [37,38] and has low stability to oxygen and water, as
well as lower conductivity, than in the p-doped state [20]. As a
consequence, it has high self-discharge (i.e., it is easily oxidised
back to the neutral form) and has low cycle-life in devices. To
overcome these disadvantages, polythiophene derivatives with a
lower band-gap (i.e., derivatives that are n-doped at less nega-
tive potentials) can be prepared [29,30,91]. By substituting at the
3-position of the thiophene ring with phenyl, ethyl and alkoxy
groups stability to oxygen and water can be further improved
[90]. A further approach is to add electron withdrawing groups
to these substituents. The general structure of these substituted
thiophene derivatives is presented in Fig. 3h. Some of these deriva-
tives are poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) (Fig. 3i),
poly(3-(4-fluorophenyl)thiophene) (PFPT) (Fig. 3j), poly(3-(3,4-
difluorophenyl)thiophene) (MPFT), and poly(1-cyano-2-(2-(3,4-
ethylenedioxylthienyl))-1-(2-thienyl)vinylene) (ThCNVEDT) [30].
There are few reports of n-doped thiophene derivatives being used
as supercapacitor materials because of intrinsic difficulties in the
n-doping process [89], which result in a strong dependence of the
behaviour on the size of the counter ion and on the solvent.

A successful strategy to overcome the problem of the n-doped
polymer is to use carbon as the negative electrode in an asymmetric
configuration, with the p-doped polymer as the positive electrode.
This results in a device with superior specific power (compared
with carbon–carbon supercapacitors) and that can be cycled at least
10 000 times [20].

The potential range and specific capacitance of some polythio-
phene derivatives are in Tables 3 and 5. A popular thiophene
derivative is poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and its
structure is given in Fig. 3i. The polymer is highly conductive (see
Table 2), as are many of the thiophene derivatives, and can be p-
doped and n-doped. The polymer has a higher potential range of
1.4 V, but the smallest specific capacitance due to a combination

of the large molecular weight of the monomer unit and the low
doping level [12].

The literature on PEDOT has grown rapidly in
recent years due to its extremely desirable properties
[5,29–31,40,44,46,48,54,78,87,92–106]. This polymer is elec-

ron rich and consequently has a low oxidation potential [104]
ogether with a wide potential window over which the capacitance
s high (1.2–1.5 V wide) [30,87,99] (also see Tables 1 and 3). The
olymer has a low band-gap of 1–3 eV, is highly conducting in
he p-doped state (300–500 S cm−1) [5], has good thermal and
hemical stability and high charge mobility that results in fast
lectrochemical kinetics [5,29,99,107]. The main reason why
EDOT has very fast kinetics is its high surface area [99] coupled
ith high conductivity. The polymer has also been found to have

ood film-forming properties [107] and can be switched rapidly
ith a minimum of side reactions leading to a long cycle-life [104].
n the negative side, because of its large molecular weight and
doping level of around 0.33 [5], it has a relatively low specific

apacitance of around 90 F g−1 [12]. Lota et al. [5] claim a capaci-
ance of 180 F g−1 is possible with PEDOT, but the authors reported
his value for a thin film that is impractical for energy-storage
urposes. When the authors prepared a pellet (10–20 mg), the
EDOT gave a capacitance of 80–100 F g−1, as expected. Another
isadvantage of this polymer is that the monomer cannot be
issolved in aqueous solvents. Consequently, a volatile and toxic
rganic solvent, such as acetonitrile, is generally used to deposit
he polymer.

PEDOT has been used in both symmetric supercapacitors (Type
device) and a hybrid device with a PEDOT cathode and an acti-
ated carbon anode [29]. After 1000 cycles (between 0 and 1 V),
he symmetric supercapacitor has a capacity of 22 F g−1 in Et4NBF4
n propylene carbonate (PC) and 27 F g−1 in LiPF6 in ethylene
arbonate/dimethyl carbonate (EC/DMC), while the asymmetric
upercapacitor, after 1000 cycles, has a capacity of 19 F g−1 in PC
nd 50 F g−1 in EC/DMC [29].

Many polythiophene derivatives have lower capacitances in the
-doped state relative to the p-doped state, as can be seen in
able 3. It has been found that poly(3-(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-
hiophene) (PTFMPT) has the same charge for n- and p-doping
14] but exhibits ‘charge trapping’ where cycling of the mate-
ial results in the formation of electronically isolated regions in
he material. Consequently, less charge is released on discharge
han on charge. Laforgue et al. [108] constructed a conducting
olymer/carbon/binder electrode and observed charge trapping in

nitial cycles, but this decreased with continued cycling [108]. The
est results were found using poly(3-(4-fluorophenyl)thiophene)
PFPT), where the n- to p-doping ratio is 60%. When using polythio-
hene as the conducting polymer, the specific capacitance of the
lectrode is 260 F g−1, but with PFPT only 110 F g−1 was achieved.
or PFPT, cyclic voltammetry for over 500 cycles resulted in lit-
le loss in capacity. In other work on PFPT by Rudge et al. [14], it
as found that n-doping was more facile at a higher electrolyte

oncentration with smaller ions, but the ability to n-dope was hin-
ered when using highly solvated alkali metal salts in acetonitrile.

udge et al. [14] suggested tetramethyl ammonium salts, in par-
icular Me4NCF3SO3, as the best results were achieved with this
lectrolyte.

PFPT has been made into a hybrid supercapacitor with an acti-
ated carbon negative electrode [109]. For 4 cm2 cells, a specific
82 133

thiophene), PThCNVEDT is poly(1-cyano-2-(2-(3,4-ethylenedioxylthienyl))-1-(2-

energy was 48 Wh kg−1 and the specific power was 9 kW kg−1,
while for 60 cm2 prototypes the specific energy was 7.5 Wh kg−1

and the specific power was 250 W kg−1. Industrial production of
conducting polymer devices is difficult and therefore it was sug-
gested that the use of composite electrodes would be advantageous
[109].

Substituting other molecular groups on the polythiophene, to
improve n-doping, results in higher molecular weight (hence lower
specific capacitance), higher materials cost and the requirement
for higher injected charge and greater mechanical strength. Poly(3-
methyl thiophene) (PMeT) is a popular thiophene derivative that
is employed in supercapacitor electrodes [79,110,111]. PMeT has
a low cost, moderately low molecular weight (and consequently
a reasonable specific capacitance of 220 F g−1), and a low resistiv-
ity (2 � cm2) [20,111]. The charge is delivered at high potentials
in a Type III device [14] and it can be cycled several thousand
times without significant loss in capacity [112]. Laforgue et al. [20],
prepared a hybrid device using PMeT with a cell ESR of approx-
imately 12 � cm2, most of which was attributed to the carbon
electrode as the measured ESR of the positive electrode was less
than 1 � cm2. In the hybrid configuration, the specific capacitance
is around 220 F g−1 for the PMeT electrode and 35 F g−1 for the final
device. In another device made from PFPT the specific capacitance
was 210 F g−1 and 29 F g−1 for the electrode and the final device
respectively. The derivatised polythiophene electrodes are highly
cycleable with 0.02% capacity loss in 2000 cycles in the case of PFPT
and 0.004% loss in 10 000 cycles for PMeT [20].

Using PMeT, a hybrid device with a carbon negative have been
constructed [111,112]. Arbizzani et al. [111] prepared a hybrid
device and achieved a specific capacitance (per gram of active mate-
rial) of 39 F g−1 and a capacity of 19 mAh g−1 at a discharge current
of 5 mA cm−2. This dropped to 28 F g−1 and 8 mAh g−1 at a sub-
stantially larger discharge current of 40 mA cm−2. At 5 mA cm−2,
the specific energy is 30 Wh kg−1 and the average specific power
is 0.50 kW kg−1, whereas at 20 mA cm−2, the specific energy is
19 Wh kg−1 and the average specific power is 1.8 kW kg−1.

Poly(cyclopenta(2,1-b;3,4-b′-dithiophen-4-one)) (PcDT) is
another interesting thiophene-based material (see Fig. 3k) which
can be used in either the p- or n-doped state [113]. The doping
level, as determined from cyclic voltammetry, was 0.19 dopants
per monomer unit, significantly lower than polythiophene. The p-
and n-doping states give 70 F g−1 and the energy and power per
mass of active material are around 6 Wh kg−1 and 1 kW kg−1 (at
18 s discharge), respectively. This device has a higher cell voltage
of 2–3 V compared with polyaniline and polypyrrole (1 V), but
the n-doped form is very unstable. After 20 cycles, the capacity
decreases from 35 to 10 mC cm−2 but remains constant for the
next 80 cycles.

Other devices have been made using polythiophene deriva-

tives and their specific energy and power has been calculated (per
active material). Villers et al. [30] achieved for 1-cyano-2-(2-(3,4-
ethylenedioxylthienyl))-1-(2-thienyl)vinylene (PThCNVEDT, see
Fig. 3l) a maximum specific energy and power of 40 Wh kg−1 and
10 kW kg−1. Ferraris et al. [96] quote values of 45 Wh kg−1 and

1 kW kg−1 for a poly-3-(4-cyanophenyl) thiophene (2.9 V) elec-
rochemical capacitor in acetonitrile. Laforgue et al. [109] obtain
alues of 48 Wh kg−1 and 9 kW kg−1 for a carbon/P-PFPT hybrid
apacitor in propylene carbonate. When constructing a prototype,
aforgue et al. [109] achieved device performance of 7 Wh kg−1 and
50 W kg−1.

When using carbon as the negative electrode [30] there was a
inear charge–discharge curve when the carbon was the limiting
lectrode whereas there was a more battery-like curve when the
arbon was in excess that suggested redox-type behaviour in
he conducting polymer. Using the thiophene derivatives 3-(4-
uorophenyl)thiophene (PFPT), 3-(3,4-difluorophenyl)thiophene
P-MPFPT), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and 1-
yano-2-(2-(3,4-ethylenedioxylthienyl))-1-(2-thienyl)vinylene
PThCNVEDT) typically 50–70% of the capacitance remained after
000 cycles [30].

.4. Room-temperature ionic liquid electrolytes

In general, ionic liquids have desirable electrolyte properties
s they usually have high ionic conductivity, low vapour pressure,
on-flammability, a wide electrochemical window, and high ther-
al stability [114,115]. A number of electrodes and devices have

een prepared using these electrolytes with conducting polymers.
alducci et al. [110] prepared a hybrid supercapacitor device based
n an activated carbon negative with a PMeT positive electrode and
n ionic liquid as the electrolyte, namely, N-butyl-N-methyl pyrro-
idinium bis-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide. This ionic liquid was
hosen as it has a low melting temperature, and is hydrophobic and
ighly cycleable with a wide voltage window that allows hybrid
upercapacitor operation between 3.43 and 1.5 V. The device exhib-
ted a specific energy of 14 Wh kg−1 and power of 1.9 kW kg−1.
his supercapacitor was cycled 16 000 times. After 1000 cycles,
he coloumbic efficiency was 99.3%, the capacitance was 15 F g−1

nd the capacity was 6 mAh g−1. After 16 000 cycles, the average
ower was 90% of the initial value and the energy was 40–50% of
he original value. The ESR with a large separation of electrodes
f 0.5 mm was 17 � cm2. Other recent work [116] has utilised
EDOT with the ionic liquid: 1-ethyl 3-methyl imidizolium bis-
rifluoromethylsulfonyl imide as the electrolyte which is more fluid
han the electrolyte used by Balducci et al. [110]. For an electrode
ith 19 mF cm−2 capacitance, the ESR was approximately 5 � cm2.

In the past, the deposition of the homo-polymers from ionic
iquids has proven difficult and the resultant layers exhibit poor
inetics for both the charge and discharge reactions that are mainly
ue to dense growth. Snook and Best [117] combined two poly-
ers (PPy and PEDOT) as one layer using electrodeposition from
mixed monomer solution in an ionic liquid, namely, 1-butyl-
ethylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (C4mpyr

FSI). This creates a superior polymer layer with improved mor-
hology and higher ionic transport, while maintaining a similar
pecific capacitance to the homo-polymer PPy. Less dense growth
eems to occur due to the mismatch of growth between the two
onducting polymers.

.5. Thiophene/imidizolium

In work carried out by Naudin et al. [118], a thiophene monomer
as covalently attached to an imidizolium counter ion. This is part

f a class of conducting polymers which are self-doped where the

ounter ion is covalently attached. The polymer is p- and n-dopable
t potentials centred at 0.65 V vs. Ag|Ag+ (p-doping) and −2.0 V vs.
g|Ag+ (n-doping). Charge compensation for both oxidation and
eduction is achieved via the anion. Thus, the presence of a perma-
ent positive charge on the polymer backbone may be useful for the
r Sources 196 (2011) 1–12

development of supercapacitors where the charge compensation is
solely by anions in the supporting electrolyte.

2.6. Redox conducting polymers

Typical conducting polymers have discharge capacities that
are not much higher than 100 mAh g−1. Performance can be
increased by functionalising the polymer with electroactive moi-
eties. Poly(1,5-diaminoanthraquinone) (pDAAQ) with the redox
active anthraquinone moiety is an example of a redox conducting
polymer [35,119]. Another example is poly(2-2′-dithiodianiline)
(pDTDA) [119]. This polymer has a high conductivity (0.3–2 S cm−1

from −2.0 to 0.8 V) [35], a specific capacity of 238 mAh g−1, a wide
potential window of approximately 2.3 V, fast redox kinetics, a high
electrical conductivity, and the two redox reactions occur at the
same potential. A symmetrical device was made from the poly-
mer and achieved 25–46 Wh kg−1 and 10.2–30.5 kW kg−1 per active
mass at discharge rates of 30–90 C. The specific power, however,
seems high (it is quoted per active mass) and is unlikely to be
translated to a device performance (as quoted per device mass).

2.7. Composites

A list of general composites and treatments of the conduct-
ing polymers and the specific capacitances achievable is given in
Table 4. With the exception of mixing with ruthenium oxide, which
is extremely costly, the specific capacitances are generally below
500 F g−1. Combining polypyrrole with iron oxide to achieve a spe-
cific capacitance of around 400 F g−1 is very promising [41]. This
cheap metal oxide could produce a supercapacitor electrode of high
specific energy.

It appears that the main advantage of compositing is not
improved specific energy but, in fact, the improved stability of
the materials (improved cycleability) and superior conductivity.
Strategies for improving cycle-life that are often limited by the
swelling and consequent breakage of the polymers, include com-
positing with carbon nanotubes to allow room for swelling as well
as irradiation [49–51] or sonication [54] during production of the
conducting polymer. Composite electrodes of polymers with other
materials have been investigated mainly to extend cycle-life and
improve conductivity, but many other benefits are seen to arise as
outlined in the examples below.

2.7.1. PEDOT/PSS
When doped with a polyanion such as polystyrenesulfonate

(PSS), PEDOT has good compatibility with polar group polymers
and allows good device performance when using aqueous elec-
trolytes. In order to achieve high specific power in a supercapacitor
device, the fast kinetics of the electrochemical process are required.
In organic media, the PEDOT/PSS material does not swell and this
indicates a high ionic resistance and a slow electrochemical pro-
cess [107]. Blending this composite material (PEDOT/PSS) with
polyethyleneoxide (PEO), which is an ionic conductor, improves
the ionic conductivity of PEDOT. The PEO phase swells in ace-
tonitrile to allow easier ion motion. Using 50% PEDOT–PSS/PEO, a
specific power of 100 W kg−1 is achieved and appears to be a very
small. Regardless, the authors claimed that the PEDOT–PSS formed
a highly porous structure that results in very fast and efficient
electrochemical reaction. Nonetheless, the power values measured
here do not support this assertion.

In other work, the combination of PEDOT with the PSS dopant

[120,121], provided low ionic resistance, but the kinetics were
limited by a high electronic resistance. Ghosh and Inganas [120]
claimed that when the electrode was put in pure water it swelled
extensively and underwent cracking. High interfacial resistance
arises [122] due to a low compatibility between the electrolyte

nd polymer. The charge-transfer resistance was reduced [120,122]
y crosslinking the conducting polymer with Mg2+ ions. Because
lectronic conductivity was now the limiting case, the pores are
lled by electrodepositing polypyrrole [120,122]. This structure or
orphology results in much better mechanical and electrical prop-

rties. In these studies [122], going from low power (100 W kg−1)
o high power (3 kW kg−1) the pure polypyrrole specific energy
educes by one-fifth. On the other hand, for the PEDOT–PSS/PPY
omposite there is no loss in energy over this power range.

.7.2. Composites with carbon nanotubes
Polypyrrole can be combined with CNTs

4,39,69,79,85,123–126] to form a composite for the posi-
ive electrode. Zhou et al. [123] used pyrrole combined with
reated functionalised single-walled CNTs and claimed 350 F g−1,
.8 kW kg−1 and 3.3 kJ kg−1 for this positive electrode. A specific
nergy of 3.3 kJ kg−1 translates to a specific energy of 0.92 Wh kg−1.
his value appears to be low compared to the specific capacitance
chieved. It also appears that the specific capacitance may have
een reported on the basis of conducting polymer weight and
ot composite weight. CNTs are electron acceptors and PPy is
n electron donor so the two form a charge-transfer complex.
ne of the electrodes gave a capacitance of 205 F g−1 at 0.4 A g−1

nd 50 F g−1 at 2.5 A g−1. This drop in capacity is due to the inac-
essibility of the composite electrode material. Even though the
omposite structure is more open than PPy itself, it must not be
ufficiently open to allow such high currents to be passed through
he structure. The best electrode prepared by these authors gave a
erformance of 350 F g−1 at 0.4 A g−1 and 200 F g−1 at 30 A g−1.

Polypyrrole can be co-deposited with carbon nanotubes by
xidising the monomer in the presence of negatively charged mul-
iwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNT) [69]. In the absence of any
ther dopant, the polymer will be doped by these nanotubes [69].
he carbon nanotubes are made by treatment in an aqueous acid
olution to form charged groups such as carboxylate, hydroxide
nd nitrous groups on the surface of the carbon. A monomer
oncentration of 0.5 M is used with a range of nanotube concen-
rations, namely, 0.025–0.4 wt% MWNTs. As the concentration of
he MWNTs increases, the thickness of the polymer coating on
he MWNT decreases. When combining with 0.4 wt% MWNTs, the
olymer layer gave a mass specific capacitance of 190 F g−1 with
n electrode specific capacitance of 2.1 F cm−2 [69]. The mass spe-
ific capacitance is slightly lower than that for pure PPy, however,
he electrode specific capacitance is quite high as generally PPy is
imited to about 0.7 F cm−2. This is due to a more open or porous
tructure resulting from the MWNT backbone.

Chen et al. [124], found that polypyrrole on its own exhibited a
lateau in capacitance with increasing film thickness (at 10 C cm−2)
nd thereby indicated limited access to the interior redox sites.
ombining PPy with carbon nanotubes resulted in a linear capac-

tance versus deposition charge up to the same film thickness
10 C cm−2). This suggests that the nanotubes open the structure
nd limit the thickness of the deposited PPy and thus allow the
ajority of internal sites to be accessed by ions.
Combining polythiophene with carbon nanotubes as a compos-

te [5] results in improved cycleability and stability. This is due
o the fact that the entangled mesoporous network of nanotubes,
hich supports the polymer structure, allows the material to adapt

o volume changes, so that the open network structure does not
eed to expand and contract as much. The volume change, which
an cause great stresses, is often the cause of poor cycleability.
Combining PEDOT with carbon means that there is no need for
olymeric binders and that conductivity in the undoped state is

mproved [5,101]. The PEDOT, like most conducting polymers, is
oorly conducting in the reduced state, so by combining with highly
onductive carbon, the conductivity at these reducing potentials is

increased. Using carbon nanotubes can increase the cycle-life as
the composite can adapt to volume changes upon insertion and
removal of counter-ions [5]. In a study by Lota et al. [5], com-
posite electrodes were prepared by three different methods: (i)
direct polymerisation on ultrasonically dispersed CNTs (130 F g−1),
(ii) mixing of polymer with carbon nanotubes (composite capaci-
tance of 120 F g−1), and (iii) electrochemical deposition of polymer
onto the CNTs (up to 150 F g−1). In separate work [101], a fourth
method was used where a negatively charged CNT suspension and
the polymer were co-deposited [87] as in previous work by Chen
et al. [69,85,124]. Successful co-deposition occurred with capaci-
tances of at least 0.5 F cm−2 achieved. A symmetric supercapacitor
[5] with electrodes made of 75 wt% PEDOT/25 wt% CNT degraded
by only 5 F g−1 (from 85 F g−1) in 3000 cycles, but the device had
a limited operating potential of 0.8 V. An asymmetric device using
80 wt% PEDOT/20 wt% acetylene black as the positive electrode and
activated carbon as the negative gave an extremely good cycle-life
with little loss in capacitance after 20 000 cycles (160 F g−1) [5].

2.7.3. Other composites
A porous structure of a carbonised polyacrylonitrile (PAN) aero-

gel support was coated with a thin film of polyaniline to give
a foam like and highly reticulated composite structure [19]. The
polyaniline is deposited in a thick coating so that the PAN aerogel
capacitance contribution is no longer dominant. The electrochem-
ical behaviour is now dominated by the polyaniline; however, the
foam like carbon structure will provide a conductive backbone
to provide high power. For a voltage range of 0.6 V, an energy of
4.25 Wh kg−1 and a power of 1.2 kW kg−1 (13 s discharge) were
achieved. Over a wider cycling voltage range of 0.8 V, an energy
of 5.8 Wh kg−1 and power of 1.5 kW kg−1 were possible [19].

Deposition of RuOx on PEDOT, either by dip hydrolysis or
electrochemical deposition, resulted in an electrode with a capac-
itance of 435 F g−1 [99]. The highest reported value for RuOx is
720–768 F g−1 [99]. In the same study, a symmetric PEDOT unit
[99] was able to deliver 12.4 mAh g−1, whereas a symmetric version
using the composite with the ruthenium oxide gave 27.5 mAh g−1

with a voltage of 1.0 V. Huang et al. [40] have claimed an impres-
sive 1409 F g−1 for a composite with ruthenium oxide with PEDOT.
While this device shows promise, the ruthenium starting materials
are too expensive to produce commercially viable supercapacitors.

Polyaniline has been combined with a polyoxometallates to
improve the stability, charge propagation and energy-storage capa-
bility [42]. An electrochemical co-deposition was found to be the
most successful. This supercapacitor could be cycled for at least
2000 cycles while retaining around 115 F g−1 but only being cycled
over a voltage range of 0–0.5 V. Polyoxometallates have also been
combined with conducting polymers in other work [42–44] but are
more likely to find application based on the photoelectrochemical
ability of polyoxometallate structures.

2.8. Prototypes

To date, prototypes with only small geometric areas have been
made with conducting polymers and, in general, propylene carbon-
ate rather than acetonitrile has been used as the host solvent for the
electrolyte [33]. Hybrid supercapacitor modules/stacks have been
made by Laforgue et al. [20] with PMeT as the positive electrode
and activated carbon as the negative, and delivered 3 V and more
than 1.5 kF capacitance and 2–3 kW of power. Such devices used

carbon-coated aluminium current collectors and had a resistance
of 33 m�. From capacitance and ESR data it was calculated that the
device gave 5 Wh kg−1 and 2 kW kg−1. The authors estimated with
mass optimisation that a device with an energy of 13 Wh kg−1 and
power of 5 kW kg−1 could be achievable.

B is carbon black. Funct-C refers to functionalised carbons, AC refers to activated
arbon, CPs refers to conducting polymers and CP comp refers to conducting polymer
omposites.

Du Pasquier et al. [13] have constructed an asymmetric device
ith a lithium titanate (Li4Ti5O12 or LTO) anode and a PFPT cathode.

TO has excellent stability and rate capability as it is a zero-strain
aterial [127]. Supercapacitor devices based on LTO/C have the

ollowing performance, 20 Wh kg−1, 90% utilisation, the ability to
e charged at 10 C charge rates, and a cycle-life of the order of
000 cycles. On the downside, this system suffers from high self-
ischarge. The positive electrode (PFPT) delivers 270 F g−1 and a
apacity of 40–45 mAh g−1, while the negative electrode (LTO)
chieves a capacity of around 160 mAh g−1. Constructing a device
ith both these positive and negative electrodes and using 7 plates,
specific energy of 12 Wh kg−1 can be achieved based on device
eight. This device can be charged at the 10 C rate and discharged

t the 100 C rate. In one of these devices, 14% of the capacitance
as lost after 1500 cycles.

Wang et al. [73] proposed a new anode for a flexible energy-
torage device made entirely of conducting polymer electrodes
i.e., both the cathode and the anode). The cathode was polypyr-
ole and the anode was styryl-substituted dialkoxyterthiophene
poly(OC(10)DASTT)) on a Ni/Cu-coated nonwoven polyester. The
ischarge efficiency was measured at 94% and the capacity was
9.1 mAh g−1.

.9. Comparison with other types of supercapacitor materials

A comparison of the specific capacitances of conducting poly-
er and conducting polymer composites with other supercapacitor
aterials is given in Fig. 5. It is obvious that both conduct-

ng polymer and metal oxide materials (generally referred to as
seudo-capacitors) increase the amount of specific capacitance
vailable for a device when compared with carbon-based superca-
acitor materials, but this is generally at the sacrifice of cycle-life.
he other notable point, at the opposite end of the scale, is that
uthenium oxide is capable of giving specific capacitances that
re far superior to those of all other materials. In reality, how-
ver, ruthenium oxide is far too expensive to be a practical option
or supercapacitors. Polyaniline is the most promising material
hen considering the specific capacitance of conducting polymers
aterials. The specific capacitance can, however, vary significantly

epending on the method of production of the polymer. Moreover,

tilisation of polyaniline as a supercapacitor material is com-
licated by the requirement for sufficient proton activity in the
lectrolyte solution to give satisfactory cycling. A variety of val-
es for manganese oxide are given in Fig. 5 and this is because
apacitance is dependent on the phase, morphology and form of
r Sources 196 (2011) 1–12

the oxide that vary according to the method of synthesis. Nev-
ertheless, this material appears to be the greatest competitor to
conducting polymers as a supercapacitor material. Specific capaci-
tances comparable to that of polyaniline are possible with the other
conducting polymer materials by making a composite with, for
example, PEDOT and iron oxide. The advantages of such a composite
is that the specific capacitance is high and the flexible nature of the
film assists the production of devices. Other conducting polymer
composites (for example with carbon materials) often do not result
in greater specific capacitances, but have many other advantages
such as increased cycle-lives and charge rates.

3. Conclusions

Conducting polymers offer many advantages as supercapacitor
electrodes. They are flexible, highly conductive, easily processable
and can be made into films. Many conducting polymers exhibit
high specific capacities and capacitances, while being able to deliver
energy at a relatively rapid rate. The major disadvantage of the con-
ducting polymers when used as supercapacitor electrode is poor
cycle-life. In general, symmetric supercapacitors based on con-
ducting polymers will have a lower cycle-life than those based on
carbon. This is unavoidable, because as anions or cations are doped
or undoped into the conducting polymer, there is a correspond-
ing volume change of the electrode when compared with carbon
supercapacitors which involve only simple ion sorption and des-
orption. The literature tends to give vague reports of cycle-life of
conducting polymer devices. Authors claim ‘little’ loss in capac-
itance over thousands of cycles but the depth of these cycles is
usually not quoted. The main strategies for improving cycle-life
include irradiation or sonication during production, or composit-
ing the conducting polymer with carbon nanotubes to increase
volume, improve porosity and allow room for swelling of the con-
ducting polymer. A more recent method for increasing porosity
and influencing the morphology of the conducting polymer elec-
trode materials has involved co-deposition of different conducting
polymers in an ionic liquid. It is anticipated that this should also
increase cycle-life due to a greater degree of freedom to accommo-
date swelling of the electrode and a smaller amount of continuous
thick conducting polymer material.

A degree of caution with over interpreting specific capacitance,
energy and power data in the literature has to be applied. This is
due to the fact that many numbers quoted are not device values and
quite often relate only to the active material and do not include the
mass of the binders, conductive carbon fillers, electrolyte and pack-
aging. Again, this makes comparison of numbers in the literature
often difficult.

Many investigations focus on mass specific properties and quote
values per mass of active material. Often, however, the more impor-
tant parameter is the area specific values for the devices. In other
words, often (electrode) area specific capacitance (F cm−2) can be
just as important as mass specific capacitance (F g−1). This means
that the amount of capacitance for a given electrode geometric area
will give an idea as to the device capacitance that is possible. In this
respect, PEDOT is superior to many other conducting polymers due
to its high porosity and deep accessibility of ions to the interior sites
of the polymer layer. This means that while having a low mass spe-
cific capacitance (typically 90–100 F g−1) it can still produce a large
electrode specific capacitance (well in excess of 5 F cm−2), which
will translate to a large absolute device capacitance.
It should be noted, that the chemical method of deposition is
limited in terms of how much polymer can be produced as a film.
Consequently, this method is most often only suitable for thin
films. If the capacitance of these thin films is converted to capac-
itance per area of electrode the value is lower when compared

o carbon-based supercapacitors. On the other hand, the use of
lectrochemical deposition methods yields thicker deposits of the
onducting polymer that lead to broader peaks in the cyclic voltam-
ograms and thereby suggesting slower kinetics. Consequently,

nly small geometrical area prototypes of supercapacitors have
een made with conducting polymers and new strategies need to
e devised to make both electrodes and devices with high specific
apacitances. It is proposed that room-temperature ionic liquids
RTILs) will play an important part in harnessing the power of con-
ucting polymers in supercapacitor devices. Furthermore, RTILs
ill most likely increase the cycle-life of the conducting polymer
aterials in supercapacitor devices.
Conducting polymers are most promising for supercapacitors

ith asymmetric configurations, i.e., with a conducting-polymer-
ased positive electrode and a carbon-based negative electrode.
hese devices appear to have much greater cycle-life as the con-
ucting polymer electrode experiences a smaller voltage swing.
lso, a range of composites, in particular with carbon-based mate-
ials, are promising in terms of improving the characteristics
f the positive electrode. When comparing such materials with
etal oxides, they can achieve comparable specific capacitance

t an appreciably lower cost and with the added benefit of supe-
ior mechanical properties and often also superior conductive
roperties. For these reasons, conducting polymers are promising
upercapacitor materials.
