The electrodes mass ratio of MnO2/activated carbon supercapacitors has been varied in order to monitor
its influence on the potential window of both electrodes and consequently to optimize the operating
voltage. It appeared that the theoretical mass ratio (R = 2), calculated considering an equivalent charge
passed across both electrodes, is underestimated. It was demonstrated that R values of 2.5–3 are better
adapted for this system; the extreme potential reached for each electrode is close to the stability limits

cycling up to 2 V, the best performance was obtained with R = 2.5. The specific capacitance increased
from 100 to 113 F g−1 during the first 2000 cycles, then decayed up to 6000 cycles and finally stabilized
at 100 F g−1. SEM images of the manganese based electrode after various numbers of thousands cycles
exhibited dramatic morphological modifications. The later are suspected to be due to Mn(IV) oxidation
and dissolution at high potential values. Hence, the evolution of specific capacitance during cycling of

ell voltage depends on the stability window of the electrolyte; the
ighest values are obtained with non-aqueous electrolytes, reach-

ng 2.7 V in industrial systems [3]. However, such media are quite
xpensive, ecologically unfriendly and require cell construction in
ir-free atmosphere. For aqueous electrolytes, the theoretical sta-
ility window is 1.23 V and is practically around 1 V for symmetric
apacitors with carbon electrodes [4]. Although the capacitance val-
es are higher and the equivalent series resistance (ESR) is lower

n such electrolyte in comparison to the organic medium, the cell

oltage is too low and should be improved in view of potential
pplications.

Lately, asymmetric cells coupling electrodes operating
eversibly in different potential range have been presented as

a promising way to increase voltage in aqueous electrolyte. For
the negative electrode, the material of choice is activated carbon
(AC) [5,6] because of its low cost, good polarizability, high specific
surface area and pore diameter adaptable to the size of ions.
Moreover, the presence of heteroatoms (N, O, or P) allows the
specific capacitance to be enhanced owing to pseudofaradic charge
transfer reactions [1,5,7–11]. In the case of the positive electrode,
battery-like metal oxide (operating at constant potential during
charging and discharging) is the first electrode material which
has been investigated. A voltage of 1.6 V is reached with AC as
negative electrode and a battery-like material as positive electrode
in alkaline medium; however, this system displays a short cycle
life and a low power density [12,13]. Another possibility is to use
a Li–intercalation positive electrode with a lithiated electrolyte
[14–16]. Even if the capacitance and operating voltage (1.4–1.8 V)
seem quite interesting, these supercapacitors exhibit a poor cycle
life. Conducting polymers have been also used as positive electrode
in acidic medium [17]. An asymmetric polyaniline/activated carbon
cell exhibits a high specific capacitance (more than 300 F g−1) but
a small voltage, whereas the PEDOT/activated carbon system can
operate up to 1.8 V with a lower specific capacitance of 120 F g−1

[17]. Nevertheless, the use of conducting polymers as positive

electrode is limited by the low stability of the materials [18].

Metal oxides presenting a potential swing during
charge/discharge were widely investigated, the most popular
being ruthenium oxide with capacitance values up to 700 F g−1

[19]. In a recent work coupling a ruthenium oxide positive elec-

rode and a modified activated carbon negative electrode (modified
y anthraquinone grafting for enhancing the pseudo-capacitive
haracter) [20] in acidic medium, the cell voltage reaches 1.3 V and
he specific capacitance 95 F g−1. Beside the moderate performance
f this system, the high cost of ruthenium oxide precludes further
evelopments. Therefore, cheap transition metal oxides such as
anganese oxide [21–25], iron oxide [26] and vanadium oxide

27] have been extensively investigated as positive electrode
n supercapacitors. Among the three oxides, V2O5 exhibits the
ighest specific capacitance, but a quick capacitance decay during
ycling [28]. The asymmetric supercapacitors equipped with
e3O4 and MnO2 positive electrodes can operate up to 1.8 and 2 V,
espectively [21,22]. Taking into account that manganese oxide
emonstrates a higher capacitance than iron oxide [28], it seems
o be the most adapted oxide for the positive electrode of an
symmetric supercapacitor in aqueous medium.

In order to optimize the voltage of an asymmetric
nO2/activated carbon supercapacitor, Khomenko et al. [21]

ave studied the pH influence in the range 6.4–10, and found
he largest theoretical cell voltage (2.1 V) at pH ≈ 6.4. A practical
oltage of 2 V has been validated in 0.1 mol L−1 K2SO4 (pH ≈ 7) by
alvanostatic charge/discharge cycling (195,000 cycles, with 12.5%
apacitance fade [22]). The specific capacitance of MnO2 seems
o be essentially controlled by the coating thickness. For thick
lms (≈100 �m), the capacitance value is only 150 F g−1, whereas

t reaches 1380 F g−1 for thin films (<5 �m), which is close to the
heoretical value (1370 F g−1) [29]. Recently it has also been shown
hat higher capacitance values (≈250 F g−1) can be obtained for
pinel like manganese oxide even for thick films (≈200 �m) [30].

This contribution aims at optimizing the operating conditions
f an asymmetric MnO2/AC supercapacitor at pH = 6.4, e.g., in
.5 mol L−1 Na2SO4. A MnO2/carbon nanotube (CNT) composite
31] and a commercially available activated carbon were chosen
s active materials for the positive and negative electrode, respec-
ively. In order to take advantage of the largest voltage window,
he mass ratio (R) between the positive and the negative electrode
as been adjusted taking into account formula (2) which expresses
hat the same charge is passed through both electrodes [21,22]:

= m+
m−

= C− × �E−
C+ × �E+

(2)

here m+ and m− are the mass, C+ and C− the specific capaci-
ance, and �E+ and �E− the potential window for the positive and
egative electrodes, respectively. Then, the performance of asym-
etric cells was evaluated by varying R close to the value calculated

ccording to Eq. (2). Thanks to an asymmetric cell equipped with a
eference electrode, the potential range of each electrode during
ycling of the supercapacitor could be determined. Finally, gal-
anostatic charge/discharge cycling was carried out to validate the
ptimized mass ratio for an asymmetric supercapacitor working at
V.

. Experimental

A high purity commercial activated carbon (AC, MWV-E510A
rom MeadWestvaco, USA) was used for negative electrode. The
orous texture of the activated carbon was analysed by nitrogen
nd CO2 adsorption at 77 and 273 K, respectively (Autosorb-
, Quantachrome Instruments). Before the analysis, the sample
as degassed (Flo Vac Degasser, Quantachrome Instruments)

vernight at 200 ◦C. The specific surface area was calculated from

he N2 adsorption isotherm by applying the BET equation. The

icropore volume was calculated from the application of the
ubinin–Radushkevich equation to the adsorption data up to P/P0
0.015 for N2 and P/P0 < 0.1 for CO2. Pore size distribution has been
btained from the N2 adsorption data by applying the non-linear

differential functional theory (NL-DFT) equation. X-ray photoelec-
tron spectra (XPS) were recorded on the powder with a VG ESCALAB
250 spectrometer using an Al K� monochromatic source (15 kV,
15 mA) and a multidetection analyzer, under 10−8 Pa residual pres-
sure.

A paste was prepared by mixing the AC (80%), acetylene
black (Pure Black, Superior Graphite Co., USA, 10%) and PTFE
(10%) binder. A composite of amorphous manganese oxide (a-
MnO2·nH2O) with carbon nanotubes (CNTs, 15 wt%) was prepared
by adding Mn(OAc)2·4H2O to a suspension of CNTs (Baytubes,
Bayer, Germany) in aqueous KMnO4, according to reference [31].
The mixture was stirred during 6 h at ambient temperature; the
precipitated a-MnO2·nH2O/CNT composite was filtered and thor-
oughly washed several times with distilled water, and finally
dried at 120 ◦C overnight. A paste was prepared by mixing the
composite (90 wt%) and PTFE (10 wt%). Both pastes of AC and a-
MnO2·nH2O/CNT composite were rolled up in order to obtain films.
Electrodes were prepared by punching pellets (1 cm diameter) in
the AC and MnO2/CNT composite based pastes. Masses were com-
prised between 5–8 mg and 12–16 mg for the AC and MnO2/CNT
electrodes, respectively.

The electrodes were pressed and wetted in deaerated
0.5 mol L−1 Na2SO4 before building the cells. Two-electrode cells
were assembled using a Teflon Swagelok® construction with gold
current collectors and glassy fibrous separator. A special two-
electrode cell equipped with a Hg/Hg2SO4 reference electrode
(SME) was also used in order to determine the potential window
of each electrode during cycling the supercapacitor. For three-
electrode cell experiments, the auxiliary electrode was a graphite
rod and SME was the reference electrode. The two-electrode cells
were built with deaerated 0.5 mol L−1 Na2SO4, while the electrolyte
was not deaerated when the SME reference was used. All potentials
are further expressed versus the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE).
A VMP2 (Biologic, France) multichannel potentiostat/galvanostat
was used for cyclic voltammetry at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 and
galvanostatic charge/discharge cycling.

Surface morphology was analysed by scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) (Hitachi S4500) on fresh MnO2/CNT compos-
ite electrodes and on electrodes aged in a supercapacitor during
various periods of time.

3. Results and discussion

The nitrogen adsorption isotherm of the activated carbon (AC)
(Fig. 1a) is characteristic of a microporous material with some
amount of mesopores favourable for ions transportation [5]. The
data extracted from this isotherm demonstrate a well-developed
porosity (Table 1). Fig. 1b shows a broad distribution of micropores
size, with pores ranging from ultramicropores to supermicropores.
Beside carbon, oxygen (2.4 at%) was the only element detected by
XPS on the surface of AC.

Fig. 2 presents the cyclic voltammograms (CV) of AC in non-
deaerated 0.5 mol L−1 Na2SO4 for different values of negative

potential cut-off, from −0.36 to −1.06 V vs. NHE. The vertical line
at −0.377 V vs. NHE corresponds to the equilibrium potential for
water reduction in 0.5 mol L−1 Na2SO4 (pH = 6.4). For the smallest
potential window, the voltammogram exhibits a quasi rectangular
shape, characteristic of a pure capacitive electrode, confirming that

he amount of oxygenated surface groups is low. When the negative
otential cut-off decreases, few reduction humps appear at −0.2,
0.6 and −0.85 V vs. NHE, respectively, during the negative poten-

ial sweep, while an oxidation wave centred at around 0.55 V vs.
HE is observed during the positive potential scan. It must be noted

hat the amplitude of the oxidation peak increases when the neg-
tive potential cut-off reaches lower values and that the hump at
0.2 V vs. NHE is only observable for the two curves with the lowest
egative potential cut-off. Since the experiment was carried out in
on-deaerated medium, hydrogen peroxide species can be formed
t low potentials and may oxidize the carbon surface [32,33]. By
ontrast, if CV was recorded in a deaerated medium, such peaks did
ot appear. Therefore, the reduction hump at −0.2 V vs. NHE, e.g., at
igher potential than −0.377 V vs. NHE is attributed to the activity
f oxidized species formed during surface oxidation by hydrogen
eroxide. The redox peaks located at lower values than the poten-
ial for water reduction, e.g., −0.6 and −0.85 V vs. NHE, respectively,
an be ascribed to the reversible storage of nascent hydrogen at
he surface of the activated carbon [2,34]. During the operation of
supercapacitor, these pseudofaradic contributions may enhance

he specific capacitance of the AC electrode, and the reversibility of
he process remains high as long as di-hydrogen is not produced.

he current leap appearing at potential values lower than −1 V vs.
HE is ascribed to the formation of di-hydrogen at the surface of

he electrode. Consequently, the lowest potential limit for a super-
apacitor negative electrode based on AC in 0.5 mol L−1 Na2SO4 is

about −0.96 V vs. NHE. In this electrolyte, the over-potential for
hydrogen evolution is around 0.6 V with AC, whereas an activated
carbon with a specific surface area of 1390 m2 g−1 and an oxygen
amount of ≈2.5 at% demonstrated over-potentials close to 0.35 and
0.1 V in 3 mol L−1 KOH and 3 mol L−1 H2SO4 electrolytes, respec-
tively [34].

Fig. 3 presents the CVs recorded for AC and for the MnO2/CNT
composite in their maximum stability window for the considered
electrolyte, e.g., 0.5 mol L−1 Na2SO4. As already explained in lit-
erature, the CV characteristics of the MnO2/CNT composite are
essentially related to reversible pseudo-faradic transitions involv-
ing ions exchange with the electrolyte [29]. It clearly appears that
the two materials reversibly operate in a different potential range.
In other words, by implementing them in an asymmetric super-
capacitor, one can expect to extend the voltage window by an
appropriate equilibration of electrodes mass.

Considering the MnO2/CNT composite, the potential window
is limited by Mn(IV) to Mn(VII) oxidation for the highest limit (at
1.19 V vs. NHE) and Mn(IV) to Mn(II) reduction for the lowest limit
(at 0.47 V vs. NHE) [35], which implies a maximum theoretical win-
dow of 0.72 V for the positive electrode (�EMnO2 ) of the asymmetric
supercapacitor [21]. According to Fig. 3, the lowest limit for avoid-

ing di-hydrogen production at the negative AC electrode should
be around −0.96 V vs. NHE. All limits are presented on this figure
by full vertical lines, and �EAC and �EMnO2 represent the theo-
retical potential variations that both electrodes should undergo,

espectively, in an asymmetric system. The specific capacitance,
stimated from the CVs (Fig. 3) is 178 and 179 F g−1 for the AC and
nO2/CNT composite electrodes, respectively. Then, according to

q. (2), the theoretical R between the positive MnO2 and negative
C electrodes is around 2.

Electrochemical investigations were carried out with an elec-
rode mass ratio R = 2 and using a two-electrode cell where a
eference electrode was added; in such a way, the operating poten-
ial of each electrode and E0 V, corresponding to the electrodes
otential when the cell voltage is 0, could be determined as function
f voltage. Fig. 4(a) presents the extreme potential reached by both
lectrodes when the cell is galvanostatically cycled from 0 V (E0 V)
p to different voltage values. For a voltage of 2 V, the E0 V value

s around 0.65 V vs. NHE, which is higher than the expected value
f 0.47 V vs. NHE from Fig. 3. Consequently, the operating window
f the MnO2/CNT positive electrode is noticeably diminished, and
ts maximum potential in Fig. 4(a) reaches the positive limit for

n(IV) oxidation at a voltage of 1.7 V which is lower than the value

f 2–2.1 V expected from three-electrode cell investigations (Fig. 3).
onsidering Fig. 3, it is also interesting to note that the E0 V value
0.65 V vs. NHE) is higher than the oxidation potential of hydrogen.
or this reason, a pseudo-capacitive contribution is added to the

n rate 2 mV s−1. The horizontal lines show the maximum and minimum potential

classical double layer capacitance of AC, leading to a higher spe-
cific capacitance value of 190 F g−1 at the negative electrode. Due
to these two features and according to Eq. (2), the theoretical R = 2
is underestimated.

Fig. 4(b) and (c) present the extreme potential of the electrodes
vs. voltage for mass ratios of 2.5 and 3, respectively. By comparison
with Fig. 4(a), it is now clear that the maximum acceptable potential
for the MnO2/CNT electrode is reached for a higher voltage, while
the minimum potential of the AC electrode is extended towards
more negative values. Both mass ratios seem better adapted for this
system and may allow cell voltages of 2 V or more to be reached.

(b) in deaerated 0.5 mol L−1 Na2SO4. For low voltage windows, the
CVs exhibit a rectangular shape, characteristic of an ideal capacitive
behaviour. At higher voltage windows, an increase of capacitance
is observed at high voltage and a wave appears during the negative
sweep around 0.5 V. As shown in Fig. 4(b) and (c), at voltage higher

than 1.45 V, the potential of the negative electrode becomes lower
than the thermodynamic limit for water reduction (−0.377 V vs.
NHE) and hydrogen is stored. Therefore, the current leap above

eversible oxidation [34], respectively. However, the redox features
re more pronounced for the capacitor built with R = 2.5 (Fig. 5).
ince the maximum potential of the positive electrode is higher in
ig. 4(b) than in (c), partial oxidation of Mn(IV) into Mn(VII) and
he subsequent reversible reduction may contribute to the more
ronounced redox humps for R = 2.5 in Fig. 5(a).

Fig. 6 presents the galvanostatic charge–discharge characteris-
ics obtained for asymmetric supercapacitors built with R = 2.5 or
. For a maximum voltage lower than 1.7 V, the curves are close to
n isosceles triangle which is characteristic of an ideal capacitive
ehaviour with a good coulombic efficiency. When the maximum
oltage increases, the shape of the curves is modified due to the
edox processes linked with hydrogen storage and change of man-
anese oxidation state.

From these results, the coulombic efficiency � was determined

here C is the capacitance of the cell and m the total mass of the

resented in Fig. 7 for asymmetric cells with R = 2.5 and 3 in deaer-
ted 0.5 mol L−1 Na2SO4. According to Fig. 4, the fast increase of

imum voltage higher than ≈1.9–2.1 V are essentially attributed to
the onset of the Mn(IV) → Mn(VII) transformation at the positive
electrode. These effects occur at lower voltage for the cell with
R = 2.5 because the potential of the positive electrode is shifted to
slightly higher values. From the data shown in Fig. 7, the high-
est voltage values are 2 and 2.2 V for the cells with R = 2.5 and 3,
respectively.

In order to evaluate the cycle life of the asymmetric systems,
cells built with R = 2.5 and 3 were charged/discharged galvanos-
tatically at 1 A g−1 (Fig. 8). A deaerated electrolyte was used to
improve the stability of the supercapacitors during cycling [22]. For
R = 2.5 and U = 2 V, capacitance first increases, further decreases and
reaches stabilization; the initial capacitance is close to 100 F g−1,
then reaches more than 120 F g−1 after 1700 cycles and decreases
to stabilize around the initial value of 100 F g−1 after 6000 cycles.
For R = 3 and U = 2 V, the trend is comparable with smaller values.
Keeping R = 3 and increasing the maximum voltage to 2.1 V leads
to a dramatic degradation of the performance (Fig. 8). Although a
good coulombic efficiency was observed up to 2.2 V for this ratio
(Fig. 7), Fig. 8 demonstrates that monitoring the cycle life is the
only way for validating a system and its operating parameters. In
conclusion, R = 2.5 and a maximum voltage U = 2 V are the optimal
conditions for the asymmetric cells based on AC and MnO2/CNT
composite. Under these conditions, the energy density determined
according to Eq. (1) reaches 13.9 Wh kg−1 of total electrode mate-
To the best of our knowledge, such trend in specific capacitance
variation has not been observed previously during the galvanostatic
cycling of MnO2/AC cells. Since the evolution is more pronounced

lectrode rearrangements due to oxide dissolution and precipita-
ion could be at the origin of the particular evolution of specific

erizations were performed on MnO2/CNT composite electrodes
fter different numbers of galvanostatic (1 A g−1) charge/discharge

orphology. After 2000 cycles (Fig. 9(b)), the morphology is slightly

odified and small needle-like particles are observed at the surface

f the cauliflower structure. In parallel to the modification to this

cycles (Fig. 9(c)), the needles are better defined due to a diameter
increase; the slow capacitance decay in Fig. 8 can be interpreted by
a decrease of specific surface area. For a higher number of cycles,
the MnO2/CNT electrode remained glued to the gold current collec-
tor, which indicates another electrode transformation. After 6000
cycles, a petal-like morphology is observed (Fig. 9(d)). From the
forward, these morphological transformations are due to MnO2 dis-
solution/precipitation when the potential of the positive electrode
is high enough for allowing MnO2 to be oxidized into Mn(VII).

In order to support this interpretation, an asymmetric superca-
pacitor with R = 2.5 was cycled up to U = 1.6 V. After 10,000 cycles,
the surface morphology of the positive electrode is still compact

(Fig. 9(e)) and not very different from the fresh electrode. Dur-
ing cycling, the specific capacitance of the cell increases, reaching
88 F g−1 after 3500 cycles and remains stable (Fig. 8). Hence, these
results confirm that the specific capacitance variations at U ≥ 2 V

ust be attributed to structural modifications of the positive elec-
rode which occur when its potential reaches values allowing

n(IV) to be oxidized.

. Conclusion

We demonstrated that the performance of an asymmetric
nO2/AC supercapacitor operating in 0.5 mol L−1 Na2SO4 can be

mproved by optimizing the mass ratio between the positive and
egative electrode. Based on the equivalence of charge passed
hrough both electrodes and assuming that E0 V is linked to the

n(IV) → Mn(II) reduction, a theoretical mass ratio R = 2 was esti-
ated. In practice, with R = 2, the E0 V determined in a MnO2/AC

ell with an added reference electrode is higher than the estimated
alue. Consequently, the mass ratio calculated by this assump-
ion was underestimated. In this work, the best performance was
btained with R = 2.5 and U = 2 V, allowing the extremum potential
alues for both electrodes to be close to the acceptable stability
alues.

This work also revealed the necessity of long-term galvanos-
atic charge/discharge cycling for validating a system. Although
= 2.2 V seemed to be reachable from short time experiments,

alvanostatic cycling revealed that the maximum voltage for this
ystem is 2 V. At this voltage, the morphological transformations
f the positive electrode do not seem deleterious for the perfor-
ance. At higher voltage, the MnO2/CNT electrode is considerably

ransformed due to Mn(IV) → Mn(VII) oxidation. By contrast, dur-
ng cycling at U = 1.6 V, the morphology of the positive electrode
emains unchanged and the capacitance of the system did not
ecay.

For future optimizations of the AC/MnO2 capacitor, it is manda-
ory to design positive electrodes with enhanced capacitance in
rder to reduce the value of R.
