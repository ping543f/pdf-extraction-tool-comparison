Nitrogen-containing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with open end and low specific surface area were prepared
via the carbonization of polyaniline (PANI) nanotubes synthesized by a rapidly mixed reaction. On the
basis of analyzing the morphologies and structures of the original and carbonized PANI nanotubes, the
electrochemical properties of PANI-based CNTs obtained at different temperatures as electrode materials
for supercapacitors using 30 wt.% aqueous solution of KOH as electrolyte were investigated by galvanos-

exhibit high specific capacitance of 163 F g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 and excellent rate capability
in KOH solution. Using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurement the nitrogen state and content
in PANI–CNTs were analysed, which could play important roles for the enhancement of electrochemical
performance. When the appropriate content of nitrogen is present, the presence of pyrrole or pyridone

. Introduction

Supercapacitor, which possesses high power density, high cycle
fficiency and a long cycle life, has attracted more and more atten-
ion owing to its wide range of potential applications, such as
ybrid power sources for electric vehicles, digital telecommuni-
ation systems and pulse laser technique [1]. According to the
echanism of energy storage, supercapacitor can be divided into

wo types: one is the electric double-layer capacitor (EDLC), which
tores energy through the separation of electronic and ionic charges
t the interface between electrode and an electrolyte solution.
he other is pseudocapacitor, which has Faradic reactions on the
lectrode materials [2]. Three types of electrode materials have
een investigated for supercapacitor: carbon materials [1], metal
xides, such as RuO2 and MnO2 [3] and conducting polymers, such
s polyaniline, polythiophene and polypyrrole [3]. Carbon materi-
ls are the most important and applicable electrode materials for
ommercial supercapacitor because of their stability in different
olutions, well processability and relatively low cost [4]. Other-
ise, it was found that nitrogen-rich carbon materials can also
e used as electrode materials for supercapacitors [5–11]. Lota et
l. prepared nitrogen-enriched porous carbons as electrodes by
yrolyzing nitrogen-containing polymers and their blends with
oal-tar pitch, and pointed out that combining a high surface area

and a ration of the content of nitrogen seems to be a promising
way to improve the performance of supercapacitors [12]. They also
investigated the nanotube-based composites being rich in nitrogen,
and obtained the capacitances of 160, 120 and 55 F g−1 at 1 mHz,
1 and 10 Hz, respectively [6]. Kawaguchi et al. [13] reported a
nitrogen-containing carbonaceous material by pyrolysis of 2,3,6,7-
tetracyano-1,4,5,8-tetraazanaphthalene, and discussed the roles of
nitrogen for the improvement of specific capacitance. It is believed
that the presence of nitrogen changes the electron donor/acceptor
properties of graphene layers, thus affects the formation of electric
double-layers [14]. Simultaneously, the introduction of nitrogen
could produce a pseudo-capacitance besides the electric double-
layer capacitance, enhance the wettability in electrode-electrolyte
interface, and then improve the capacitance of electrode [13].

Since the first report on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in 1991, CNTs
are of great interest due to their nanometer size, electrical con-
ductivity and mechanical performance [15]. Because of the unique
morphology, well-controlled nanostructure, surface functionality
and the cyclicity of the power supply, CNTs are regarded as suit-
able materials for electrodes in supercapacitors and lithium-ion
batteries [15–17]. The capacitances of carbon nanotube electrodes
for supercapacitors are generally in the range of 40–80 F g−1 [18].
Because the value depends upon nanotubes’ components, mor-

phologies, surfaces and pore structures, it can be enhanced by
surface modification or attaching functional groups [4,18]. Modify-
ing these nanotubes by introducing heteroatoms, such as nitrogen,
is a known application in electrochemistry [5–7]. Jurewicz et al. [7]

ctivation and ammoxidation, and found that the capacitances of
odified nanotubes are less than 100 F g−1.
Polyaniline (PANI) ranks the most potentially useful conducting

olymers because of its facile synthesis, environmental stability,
nd simple acid/base doping/dedoping chemistry [19]. PANI has
een considered as an important material for the application of
upercapacitor electrode [20–26]. The composite electrodes of car-
on and PANI show a higher capacitance and a good rate capability.
ost significantly, by controlling the synthesis conditions, PANIs
ith various shapes, such as nanowires, nanofibers, nanotubes and
ollow spheres, have been produced [27–31]. Correspondingly car-
on nanostructures with special morphologies are easily prepared
rom the PANI nanostructures by maintaining the original shapes
f PANIs through high-temperature heat treatment in an inert gas
tmosphere. Therefore we can get nitrogen-enriched carbon nano-
aterials from PANI nanostructures. From this point of view, PANIs
ith different morphologies can be considered as appropriate pre-

ursors for carbon nanomaterials containing nitrogen, which are
avourable for the electrochemical energy storage. The obvious way
o link both types of materials is the conversion of conducting poly-

ers into carbonaceous structures.
In this paper, we pay more emphasis on the preparation and

lectrochemical properties of nitrogen-containing CNTs from PANI
anotubes. As well known, a certain content of nitrogen in car-
onaceous materials will enhance the capacitance of electrode
aterials [10,12,14]. The pyrolysis of PANI at high temperatures

s a simple method to prepare nitrogen-enriched carbon materi-
ls. Although some papers have introduced the carbonization and
tructural conversion of polyaniline to carbon materials including
arbon nanotubes [32–37], there is no report on the carbonized
ANI nanomaterial as electrode for supercapacitor by now.

. Experimental

.1. Synthesis of polyaniline nanotubes

PANI nanotubes have been prepared according to the previ-
us literatures [19,38,39]. The typical process was performed as
ollows: At first, 3.423 g ammonium persulfate (Shantou Chem-
cal Factory, 98%) as the initiator and 1.09 ml aniline monomer
Tianjin Chemical Reagent Factory, 99.5%) were dissolved in 60 ml
e-ionized water, respectively. Then the initiator solution was
oured into the monomer solution quickly with vigorous stirring,
nd maintained in a quiescent state at room temperature for 24 h
o get the precipitate. The resulting precipitate was centrifugated,
ashed and dried to obtain the desired PANI nanotubes.

.2. Carbonization of polyaniline nanotubes

In the carbonization experiment, 1.0 g of PANI placed into an alu-
ina crucible was carbonized in a horizontal furnace under pure

itrogen gas atmosphere according to the following heating proce-
ure. The sample was firstly heated to 400 ◦C with a heating rate of
◦C min−1, and maintained for 2 h at this temperature, and then it
as increased to the ultimate temperatures of 600, 700, 850, 1000

nd 1100 ◦C, respectively, with a heating rate of 0.5 ◦C min−1, and
eeping for 2 h at the final temperatures. The heated samples were
eighed and named as PANI-600, PANI-700, PANI-850, PANI-1000,

nd PANI-1100, respectively.

.3. Characterization of PANI and carbonized polyaniline

anotubes

The morphologies and structures of as-synthesized and car-
onized materials were observed by scanning electron microscope
SEM, Hitachi S-4700) and transmission electron microscope (TEM,
cta 55 (2010) 7021–7027

Hitachi H-800). The specific surface areas (SBET) were obtained by
Micromeritics ASAP 2020 Instrument from the adsorption data
in the relative pressure interval from 0.04 to 0.2 P Po−1 using
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. The elemental composi-
tion (C, H and N) was determined using an elemental analyzer (Flash
EA 1112). The chemical composition and state of samples were
measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) under a pres-
sure lower than 10−7 Pa with a Thermo ESCALAB 250 instrument.
XPS spectra were recorded using monochromatic Al K� (1486.6 eV)
X-ray sources with 30 eV pass energy in 0.5 eV step over an area
of 650 �m × 650 �m to the sample. Atomic concentrations were
calculated using peak areas of elemental lines after Shirley back-
ground subtraction, and taking the sensitivity factors into account,
the asymmetry parameters, as well as the measured analyzer trans-
mission function. The sample charging was corrected using the C 1s
peak (284.6 eV) as an internal standard. The quantitative analysis
was performed with XPSPEAK4 software.

2.4. Electrode assembly and measurement

The electrochemical performances of prepared samples were
measured with a three-electrode system that was described in
previous work of our group [20]. 80 wt.% of resulting samples,
10 wt.% of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and 10 wt.% of acetylene
black were mixed together to press into the graphite sheet as the
working electrode for supercapacitor. The counter and reference
electrodes were Platinum foil and Hg/HgO electrode, respectively.
The electrolyte was 30 wt.% KOH aqueous solution. The capacitance
properties were studied by galvanostatic charge/discharge and
cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests. The galavanostatic charge/discharge
was carried out by a Program Testing System (produced by China-
Land Com. Ltd., China) with the voltage range from 0.9 to 0.01 V.
The cyclic voltammetry was taken with a CHI660B electrochemical
working station. The sweep voltage ranged from −0.85 to 0.01 V in
cyclic voltam metric measurements.

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Morphology and structure of polyaniline nanotubes and
carbonized PANI nanotubes

The morphologies of pristine PANI were observed by SEM and
TEM, and their images are shown in Fig. 1(a)–(d). As seen in Fig. 1,
the prepared PANI is nanotube in morphology with rough surface,
which is confirmed by TEM observation. The length of PANI nan-
otubes is between 1 and 3 �m, and diameters range from 100 to
200 nm. PANI nanotubes cross each other, some inner paths are
joined together and each end of tubes is open. The wall thickness
of tubes is between 65 and 75 nm. The formation of PANI nan-
otubes has been analyzed in previous reports [31,39]. Briefly, in
the primary stage, nano-sized oligomer crystallites were formed as
starting template for the nucleation of PANI nanotubes. The fur-
ther growth of nanotubes depended on the self-organization of
phenazine units.

In order to get nitrogen-containing carbon nanotubes, the pre-
pared PANI nanotubes were heated in N2 gas atmosphere at
different temperatures from 600 to 1100 ◦C. During the high-
temperature treatment, condensation and polymerization take
place with the escape of hydrogen and nitrogen atoms, remaining
the carbon skeleton. With increasing temperature, the non-carbon
atoms lost more, and the carbon skeleton would gradually shrink.

Fig. 2 displays the morphologies of the heated PANI at different
temperatures. As seen in Fig. 2, the shape generally maintains well
after heat treatment and some carbon nanotubes are destroyed and
broken into short tubes at higher temperature. The surface of the
carbonized PANI becomes smooth relatively. The TEM images effec-

f carbonized samples at different temperatures are displayed in
ig. 3. The mass loss of carbonization in Table 1 is calculated based
n the weight of previous and carbonized PANI. It can be found
hat with the temperature increasing from 600 to 1100 ◦C, the mass
oss increases correspondingly. According to the data of elemental
nalysis, we find that there is a steady decrease in nitrogen and
ydrogen contents, and an increase in carbon as the temperature

ncreased, that is consistent with the previous report [32]. The dif-
erence between the data of elemental analysis and XPS is caused
y different test philosophy. However, the variation tendency of
lemental content is the same, i.e., with the temperature increas-
ng from 600 to 1100 ◦C, the content of carbon goes up. It can be
ound that the content of oxygen is relatively low compared to that
f C and N with the temperature increasing from 600 to 850 ◦C. The
esult of above is consistent with elemental analysis.

.3. Electrochemical properties of PANI-based carbon nanotubes

To investigate the electrochemical performance of carbonized
ANI nanotubes as electrode material for supercapacitor, galavano-
tatic charge/discharge cycling measurement was performed in
OH solution. The calculated specific capacitances that are stable
fter 10 time cycles at every current density are summarized in
ig. 4. Although the PANI-based carbon nanotubes possess low spe-
ific surface areas, PANI-700 and PANI-850 electrodes exhibit high
apacities of 163 and 110 F g−1, respectively, which are higher than
hat of the pure PANI [20]. As a whole rule, the specific capacitances
ecrease with the increase of carbonized temperature from 700 to
100 ◦C, which could be related with the change of specific sur-
ace areas (in Table 2) and the decrease of total polar functional

roups [40] as well as the elemental composition. PANI-600 is an
xceptional example. Although the specific capacitance of PANI-
00 is similar to that of PANI-850 at low current density, it fades
ast with the increase of current density, which could be ascribed to
he higher polar functional group content and the unstable carbon

skeleton formed at the low temperature carbonizaton. PANI-700
has the highest capacitance in these samples. At a current density of
1 A g−1 the specific capacitance of PANI-700 is as high as 133 F g−1,
which is about 82% of the specific capacitance at the current den-
sity of 0.1 A g−1, implying the high rate capability. Compared with
the common activated carbons [1,41], PANI carbon nanotubes pos-
sess lower specific surface areas, but higher capacities, which could
be related with the chemical state and the content of nitrogen in
carbonized PANI samples [10,11,13,14].

The stable charge-discharge cycling curve of carbonized PANI
at 700 ◦C is presented in Fig. 5. The curve is not a perfect tri-

angular shape, indicating a small pseudo-capacitance besides the
electric double layer capacitance, which would be caused by the
chemical state of nitrogen in PANI-700. Cyclic voltammetry mea-
surements were carried out within the potential range of −0.85 to
0.01 V to analyze the electrochemical behavior of supercapacitor.

ig. 6 gives the cyclic voltammogram of PANI-700 electrode at dif-
erent sweep rates. Although the voltammograms are not square
nd the slopes are present, there is no obvious redox information
hich is in accordance with the previous report [11], in which

he presence of pseudo-capacitance in electrode was confirmed in
asic electrolyte, but the mechanism remains unclear. Kawaguchi
t al. [13] think that an asymmetrical rectangle of the CV curve is
ue to the reversible pseudo-faradaic reaction. Hulicova et al. [42]
hink that this slope is related to the pseudocapacitive properties
f carbonized samples, which should be ascribed to the presence of
ncorporated nitrogen in samples. This statement is in accordance

ith that deduced from the galvanostatic charge/discharege tests.
n addition, we can discover that the quicker the sweep rate is, the
igger the responsive current is, which illustrates that the electrode
aterial has well reversibility.

.4. Effects of nitrogen in PANI–CNTs on the electrochemical
erformances

The chemical state of nitrogen in PANI carbon nanotubes is
nvestigated by XPS measurement. Table 2 shows the relative
uantities of surface nitrogen-containing groups and the specific
urface areas of samples. A typical XPS spectrum of N 1s displays
n Fig. 7. The chemical state of nitrogen atoms in carbonized sam-
les could be assigned to five types according to previous reports
9,11,12,43,44]. These five types are as following binding ener-
ies: 398.4 eV (pyridine-N-6), 400.5 eV (pyrrole or pyridone-N-5),

01 eV (quaternary-N–Q), 402.6 eV (pyridine-N-oxide or ammo-
ia), 405.5 eV (chemisorbed nitrogen oxides–N–Ox). As seen in
able 2, the types of nitrogen in samples and the SBET are influenced
y the heat treatment temperature. As the temperature increasing
rom 600 to 850 ◦C, the specific surface areas decrease from 253.6

to 21.3 m2 g−1. The chemical state of nitrogen is complex with dif-
ferent heat temperatures. There are total three types of nitrogen in
carbonized products: one at 398.4 eV is attributed to the pyridine
(N-6), which is at the edge of graphene layers in six-membered
rings [11]; the other one at 400.5 eV belongs to the pyrrole or
pyridone (N-5), which is in five-member rings or combined with

oxidized form [43]; the last one at about 401 eV is the quater-
nary (N–Q), the nitrogen atom of which is in a “valley” position
[45]. These types of nitrogen groups are presented in Scheme 1.
According to Table 2, we can see that all of the samples possess

-6. In addition, PANI-600 has N-5, and PANI-850, PANI-1000 and
ANI-1100 have N–Q. Only PANI-700 possesses all these types of
itrogen. It was reported that N-6 species can be formed above the
emperature of 400 ◦C, and N-5 will be formed at higher tempera-
ure [11,45]. We surmise that with the temperature increasing from
00 to 1100 ◦C, the state of nitrogen in samples has changed from
-5 to N–Q. At higher temperature, the chemical bond of N-5 is eas-

ly broken, and the new C–N or N–Q bond forms. The content and
tate of nitrogen in samples will affect intensively the capacitive
erformance.

The insertion of nitrogen atoms into graphene layers can change
alues of EHOMO and ELUMO in order to reduce the band gap, thus
ncrease electron mobility and lower the electron work function
t the carbon/liquid interface in comparison to pure carbon [44].
here is a conclusion [46–48] that the capacitive behavior is dom-
nated by the electron mobility of the sample. The potential in the
ouble layer is shared between the solvent layer and the space-
harge layer, so the capacitance of the sample is provided by these
wo aspects. Based on this view, increased mobility of electrons
n the sample would result in a larger space charge capacitance.
mong these samples N-5 and N–Q have electron donor tendency,
o their specific capacitances are higher than that of pure PANI.
owever, PANI-1000 and PANI-1100 possessing low content of
itrogen have relatively low specific capacitances, so we think the
ppropriate content of nitrogen is a precondition for improving the
pecific capacitance. PANI-600 and PANI-850 are enriched in N-5
nd N–Q, respectively, however PANI-700 is enriched in both of
hese structures. It is reasonable to believe that possessing both of
hese structures can endow PANI-700 the highest specific capaci-
ance. In Scheme 1 we can find obviously that N-5 and N–Q have a
reat difference, in which the former occupies a “top” N position,
nd the later is in a “valley” N position. According to the report [6],
he later one shows stronger donor electron character. Quaternary
itrogen is the most appropriate position affecting the carbon elec-
ronic structure in order to lower an energy gap between lowest
noccupied molecular orbital and the highest occupied molecular
rbital. So the specific capacitance of PANI-850 possessing qua-
ernary nitrogen is higher than that of PANI-600. Ultimately we
onclude that when the appropriate content of nitrogen is present,
eing both N-5 and N–Q will enhance the capacitance with the fol-

owing reasons: one is to improve the electron mobility, the other
s to enhance the wettability of the electrode to make electrolyte

ore touch with active materials [13,14].

. Conclusions

In summary, PANI with the tubular shape was synthesized
y a rapidly mixed reaction, and then nitrogen-containing CNTs
ere prepared through high temperature treatment. The mor-

hologies, structures and electrochemical properties of PANI-based
NTs were investigated. It was found that PANI can maintain the
riginal tubular morphology after heat treatment. The carbon nan-
tubes possess the diameter of about 100 nm and length of several
icrometers with open end and low specific surface area. When

[

PANI-based CNTs were used as the electrode materials for superca-
pacitors in KOH solution, they exhibit high specific capacity and
good cyclic stability, especially PANI-700 possesses the capaci-
tance of 163 F g−1 at the current density of 0.1 A g−1. The chemical
state and content of nitrogen in carbonized PANI nanotubes were
investigated by XPS. The reasons why carbonized PANI nanotubes
have higher specific capacitance would be ascribed to the pres-
ence of pyrrole or pyridone and quaternary nitrogen when the
appropriate content of nitrogen is present, which are beneficial for
the improvements of electron mobility and the wettability of the
electrode.
