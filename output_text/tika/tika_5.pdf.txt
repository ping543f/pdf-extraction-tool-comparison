High oxygen content (10–15 at.%) nanotextured carbons were obtained by pyrolysis of sea-

weeds at 600–750 �C and applied as electrodes for supercapacitors in H2SO4, KOH and
Na2SO4 aqueous media. Interestingly, the potential stability window measured in a

three-electrode cell configuration depends both on the nature of the oxygenated surface

functionality and on the electrolyte pH. A high value of 2.4 V was observed in Na2SO4 for

the seaweeds pyrolysed at 600 �C, showing that the surface functionality strongly influ-
ences the over-potentials of di-hydrogen evolution and carbon oxidation. Symmetric

capacitors built from the seaweed carbons exhibited an excellent cycle life for voltage val-

ues up to 1.6 V, showing the promise of Na2SO4 for developing high energy density and

environment friendly systems.

1. Introduction

In the last decade, carbon materials, owing to their low cost,

good electrical conductivity, developed porosity and possibil-

ity of tailoring the nanotexture and chemical composition,

gained an interest in supercapacitor applications [1,2]. Car-

bon/carbon supercapacitors present higher power density

and longer cycle life [3,4] than accumulators.

For a supercapacitor, the amount of energy (E) stored is re-

lated to the capacitance (C) and voltage (U) according to the

relation: E = 1/2CU2. In industry, the organic electrolyte is pre-

ferred because the voltage applied between the electrodes is

higher (�2.7 V) than with aqueous electrolyte (�1 V) [5]. In
aqueous electrolyte, however, the amount of energy stored

can be enhanced either by applying materials developing

higher capacitance or by increasing the operating voltage. In

the particular case of capacitance, it can be significantly im-

proved through pseudo-faradic reactions between the aque-

ous electrolyte and active groups present on the carbon

surface [3,6,7].

Several routes are already mentioned in the literature to

obtain heteroatom-rich nanoporous carbons. Foreign atoms

such as oxygen can be introduced on the carbon surface by

different oxidation procedures using an oxygen atmosphere

[7], a plasma treatment [8] or chemical oxidation by HNO3
[9]. Nitrogen enrichment can be performed by ammoxidation

or by reaction with urea [10]. Heteroatom rich carbons can

also be obtained by the pyrolysis of a suitable oxygen or nitro-

gen containing precursor, with or without a template [11–15].

For example, we have previously shown that one-step carbon-

ization of biopolymers extracted from seaweeds or seaweeds

themselves results in high oxygen content nanotextured car-

bons [13,16]. Such carbons, owing to their high amount of

oxygenated surface functionalities (10–15 at.% oxygen), pres-

ent high capacitance values (250 F g�1) in spite of their low

specific surface area (400–700 m2 g�1), and a broad stability

potential window in 1 mol L�1 H2SO4. Symmetric capacitors

built with the seaweed based nanoporous carbons are able

to be reversibly charged/discharged more than 10,000 times

in a voltage window of 1.2 V. They outperform the activated

carbon based ones which can be polarized only up to 0.8–1.0 V

[5] in this medium.

Unfortunately, the use of H2SO4 as electrolyte presents

many technical drawbacks precluding its industrial applica-

tion, mainly due to its corrosive character towards the differ-

ent metallic components of a supercapacitor, e.g., current

collectors, connexions, can, etc. Other electrolytes as KOH

or Na2SO4 could be in turn more compatible for the superca-

pacitor industry. Actually, KOH is implemented as electrolyte

in alkaline batteries (Ni–MH) where nickel and copper current

collectors are used for positive and negative electrodes,

respectively [17]. The possibility of enhancing the capacitance

of carbon materials through fast redox reactions involving N

and O surface functionalities has been already proved in this

medium [7,10,12]. Neutral electrolytes have been used for

asymmetric systems based on metallic oxide and activated

carbon for positive and negative electrode, respectively

[18,19]. Few studies on three-electrode cell performance of

activated carbons in Na2SO4 show that the pseudo-faradic re-

dox transitions of O and N-containing electroactive surface

groups are depressed in comparison with H2SO4 [20–24].

In this report, we present the electrochemical performance

of symmetric capacitors with seaweed carbon electrodes in

KOH and Na2SO4 electrolytes. A detailed study in three- and

two-electrode cells, varying the porous texture and surface

functionality, shows that Na2SO4 performs particularly well.

In this medium, the stability potential window of seaweed

based carbons is wider than in KOH or even H2SO4. As a con-

sequence, symmetric capacitors are able to operate reversibly

up to 1.6 V in this environment friendly and less corrosive

medium.
2. Experimental

2.1. Samples preparation

The brown seaweed Lessonia nigrescens (LN) has been used as

carbon precursor. In order to get the carbon materials, the

dried seaweed was pyrolyzed in a tubular furnace under

nitrogen flow (100 mL min�1) up to 600 or 750 �C. The heating
rate was 10 �C min�1 and the maximum temperature was
hold for 3 h. The resulting black solid was then thoroughly

washed 5 times with 5 mol L�1 HCl for 24 h at 80 �C and
5 times in distilled water, in order to make sure that a neutral

pH is reached. Afterwards, the material was dried at 120 �C
overnight in an oven. The carbons obtained at 600 and

750 �C are named LN600 and LN750, respectively.
2.2. Physico-chemical characterization of the carbon
samples

The porous texture of the various carbons has been analyzed

by N2 and CO2 adsorption at 77 and 273 K, respectively (Auto-

sorb-1, Quantachrome). Before the measurements, the sam-

ples were outgassed at 200 �C overnight under vacuum. The
specific surface area was calculated from the nitrogen adsorp-

tion isotherms by applying the BET and Dubinin–Radushke-

vich equations. The non-linear density functional theory

(NLDFT) method was applied to the N2 adsorption isotherms
to determine the pore size distribution. The micro and meso-

pore volumes were determined from the N2 adsorption iso-

therms by applying the NLDFT equation. The ultra-

micropore volume and surface area were obtained by apply-

ing the Dubinin–Radushkevich equation to the CO2 adsorp-

tion data. The surface functionality of the carbon materials

was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)

using a VG ESCALAB 250 spectrometer with an AlKa mono-

chromatic source (15 kV, 15 mA) and a multidetection ana-

lyzer under a residual pressure of 10�8 Pa. The analyses

have been performed either on the as-received carbon pow-

ders or after wetting the carbon materials with the electro-

lytic solution (6 mol L�1 KOH or 0.5 mol L�1 Na2SO4) during

24 h under stirring followed by a thorough washing in dis-

tilled water and drying.
2.3. Electrochemical measurements

Composite electrodes (10–12 mg) in the form of 1 cm2 pellets

were pressed from a mixture of seaweed based carbon

(90 wt.%) and a binder (polyvinylidene fluoride PVDF:

10 wt.%). The experiments were performed in two- or three-

electrode Teflon Swagelok� systems using a glassy fibrous

separator and gold current collectors. For the three-electrode

cells, the counter electrode was a graphite rod and the refer-

ence electrode was Hg/Hg2SO4 (0.62 V/NHE) or Hg/HgO

(0.098 V/NHE) in 0.5 mol L�1 Na2SO4 and 6 mol L
�1 KOH,

respectively. All the potential values of the study are reported

vs the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE). Electrochemical

measurements were performed using a VMP multichannel

potentiostat/galvanostat (Biologic, France). The electrochemi-

cal performance of the two materials was evaluated by cyclic

voltammetry (CV) at 2 mV s�1 and galvanostatic charge/dis-

charge at 200 mA g�1.
3. Results and discussion

3.1. Physico-chemical characterization of the carbon
samples

The nitrogen adsorption isotherms and the pore size distribu-

tion (PSD) for LN600 and LN750 are plotted in Fig. 1. The type

IV isotherms with an hysteresis loop at P/P0 > 0.4 are charac-

teristic of samples with micropores and mesopores. The spe-

cific surface area and pore volumes obtained from the

adsorption measurements are listed in Table 1. The samples

exhibit moderate values of BET specific surface area (750–

1080 m2 g�1). The DR specific surface areas estimated from

the CO2 and N2 isotherms are comparable, indicating that

the micropores are mostly in the range 0.7–0.8 nm [25]. The

contribution of mesopores is rather significant (Table 1 and

Fig. 1) with pores in the range 2–4 nm.

The increase of the pyrolysis temperature from 600 to

750 �C does not only result in a somewhat more developed
porosity but it also affects significantly the surface function-

ality. The XPS data (Table 2) reveal that both nitrogen and oxy-

gen contents are reduced when the pyrolysis temperature is

increased. The chemical nature of the oxygenated functional

groups was determined by deconvolution of the C1s peak

ples are, from the most to the least represented, ether and

tone (C@O).

Taking into account earlier studies by Boehm and Voll [26],

where oxygen chemisorption is described when a carbon

material is immersed into an aqueous solution containing

di-oxygen, the surface functionality of the LN-based carbons

was analyzed by XPS after 24 h immersion in the electrolytes

(6 mol L�1 KOH and 0.5 mol L�1 Na2SO4). By such analysis, one

has a direct access to the nature of the surface functionality

in the experimental conditions of the electrochemical tests.

After contact with both electrolytes, the amount of surface

oxygen is dramatically increased whereas the nitrogen con-

tent remains unchanged (Table 3). Comparing the results ob-

tained for LN600 and LN750 before (Table 2) and after (Table 3)

immersion in the electrolyte, it appears clearly that new oxy-

genated functionalities are created on the carbon surface by

contact with the electrolyte. In particular, the amount of C–

OR type functionalities, probably phenol groups, is consider-

ably enhanced whatever the electrolyte.

By contrast, if the carbon powders are wetted in the same

conditions using a degassed (O2-free) Na2SO4 solution, the

oxygen content measured by XPS is 11.0 and 9.8 at.% for

LN600 and LN750, respectively, i.e. comparable with the val-

ues for the as-received powders (Table 2). These results con-

firm the role of dissolved di-oxygen on carbon surface

oxidation when the solutions are not degassed. Such effect

does not occur when the samples are exposed to di-oxygen

from the atmosphere because these redox reactions require
trolyte.

a simultaneous exchange of electrons and protons. The inter-

action mechanism between an active carbon surface and

electrolyte solutions has been studied in the past (see re-

viewed literature in [27]) but it was not unequivocally

explained.

From the foregoing, in order to interpret electrochemical

results obtained in aqueous electrolytes, it is very important

to know how the cells are prepared. For all the experiments

presented in this work, the electrolyte solutions were not out-

gassed before the electrochemical measurements. Therefore,

the surface functionality presented in Table 3 should be con-

sidered for further correlations to the electrochemical behav-

iour of each material.

3.2. Electrochemical characterization of the carbon
samples

3.2.1. Three-electrode cell characterization using different
aqueous electrolytes
Fig. 2 shows the cyclic voltammogramms (CV) of LN600 and

LN750 in three-electrode cells with 1 mol L�1 H2SO4 (Fig. 2a),

6 mol L�1 KOH (Fig. 2b) and 0.5 mol L�1 Na2SO4 (Fig. 2c). On

the left side, the CVs are comprised totally (Fig. 2a, left) or al-

most totally (Fig. 2b and c, left) within the thermodynamic

stability window of water. The latter is represented in all fig-

ures by two vertical lines corresponding to the potentials of

water reduction and oxidation, respectively. On the right side

of Fig. 2, the CVs have been recorded in the total stability win-

dow of the system.

In all electrolytes, LN750 displays more rectangular vol-

tammograms than LN600, confirming a higher electrical con-

ductivity for LN750 as a consequence of the higher pyrolysis

temperature.

Within the stability window of water (Fig. 2, left), the

capacitive response includes charging of the electrical dou-

ble-layer (EDL) and the pseudo-faradic contribution of the sur-

face functionality. Due to the richer surface functionality of

LN600 compared to LN750 (Table 3), reversible redox humps

are observed for LN600, independently of the electrolyte used,

while such humps are almost undetectable in the case of

LN750.

In H2SO4, the cathodic and anodic peaks are placed at

around 0.3 and 0.6 V vs NHE, respectively (Fig. 2a, left). These

peaks, generally attributed to the reversible quinone/hydro-

quinone transformation [16,28], are the most pronounced

for LN600 with the highest amount of quinone-like function-

alities (C@O in Table 3). Due to these pseudo-faradic reactions,
the capacitance is more important for LN600 (244 F g�1) than

for LN750 (209 F g�1), even if the specific surface area of

LN600 is lower than for LN750 (see Table 1).

In KOH (Fig. 2b, left) the cathodic/anodic peaks related to

the reduction/oxidation of oxygenated functionalities are

placed at �0.5 and �0.3 V vs NHE, respectively. When the
pH of the electrolytic solution is increased, the redox reac-

tions involving surface quinone groups are less important,

but some other surface functionalities as pyrone-like ones

can be active [27]. Since LN600 posses more pyrone like func-

tionalities than LN750 (see the higher amount of C–O and

C@O-like groups in Table 3), it can deliver a higher capaci-
tance (206 F g�1) than LN750 (186 F g�1).
Finally, for LN600 in Na2SO4 (Fig. 2c, left), the cathodic/ano-

dic redox humps appear at �0.1 and 0.1 V vs NHE, respec-
tively. As a consequence, LN600 presents a slightly higher

capacitance (121 F g�1) than LN750 (115 F g�1). Taking into ac-

count the lower specific surface area of LN600, it confirms

that pseudo-faradic reactions contribute to the capacitance

of this material in Na2SO4. Although Andreas and Conway

[28] stated that the pseudo-capacitive contribution of surface

oxygenated groups is negligible at neutral pH, from these data

on the two materials prepared from the same precursor, we

can affirm that pseudo-faradic reactions are possible in

Na2SO4 with an adequate surface functionality. In this sense,

LN600 contains a higher amount of all kinds of functionalities

(Table 3) than LN750, particularly the quinone-like groups

(C@O) which are twice more present than in LN750.
When comparing the results in the three electrolytes, it

can be also pointed out that LN600 and LN750 exhibit smaller

capacitance values in Na2SO4 than in H2SO4 and KOH. Such

results are in agreement with the literature data stating that

the EDL capacitance values are higher in H2SO4 than in

Na2SO4 because of the presence of protons as mobile species

with better ionic diffusion inside the pores than other ions

[21,22]. A similar interpretation can be given for understand-

ing the capacitance differences obtained in KOH and Na2SO4,

the hydroxyl ions being the mobile species in this case. Actu-

ally, the conductivity of the 0.5 mol L�1 Na2SO4 solution has

been found to be 60 mS cm�1, which is approximately one or-

der of magnitude less than in the H2SO4 and KOH solutions

considered in this study. Nevertheless, the influence of pH

and/or electrolyte ions on the EDL capacitance is not an easy

issue and some work is still necessary in this direction.

In aqueous electrolyte, when the potential range is ex-

tended to more negative values, a second redox contribution

due to hydrogen electro-sorption in the material may overlap

with the above reported ones [29]. Actually, if the potential

cut-off is lower than the thermodynamic limit for water

reduction, nascent hydrogen is produced and weakly chemi-

sorbed on the carbon surface [30]; correspondingly a hump

due to hydrogen electro-oxidation appears during the anodic

scan [29] and contributes to the overall capacitance. In Fig. 2

(right), LN600 displays anodic peaks at 0.75, �0.35 V and
0.75 V vs NHE in H2SO4, KOH and Na2SO4, respectively. More-

over, for the three electrolytes, in the region of anodic scan

between the negative potential cut-off and the equilibrium

potential for water reduction (Fig. 2, right), the anodic current

is much lower for LN600 (being close to zero) than for LN750.

It shows that, in this potential range, the EDL charging of

LN600 is comparable to the redox current involved in water

electro-reduction; by contrast for LN750, the EDL contribution

is more important, that fits well with the larger specific sur-

face area of this material.

Hydrogen chemisorption during water reduction is also at

the origin of a noticeable over-potential for H2 evolution, as

demonstrated by the shift of the negative current leap (see

Fig. 2, right). Whatever the electrolyte, the over-potential is

higher for LN600, which contains a larger amount of oxygen-

ated functionalities, than for LN750. Moreover, as it has been

already observed for glassy carbon [31] or Pt [32] electrodes,

the over-potential for H2 evolution depends not only on the

material used, but also on the electrolyte pH. In a neutral

pH solution, the over-potential observed with a glassy carbon

electrode can reach 1.2 V, whereas only a value of 0.6 or 0.8 V

is attained in acidic or basic pH, respectively. With a Pt elec-

trode, a small over-potential of 0.3 V is found in neutral elec-

trolyte, whereas any over-potential can be detected when

using acidic or basic solutions. The LN600 nanoporous car-

bon, with a moderate surface area, but a high amount of oxy-

genated surface functionalities, presents almost the same
over-potential values as glassy carbon in all the electrolytic

media (see Fig. 2), confirming that the operating potential

range in negative polarization is more important in a neutral

Na2SO4 electrolyte whatever the electrode material.

Similarly, in Fig. 2 (right), the maximum positive potential

depends both on the nature of the electrode material and on

the electrolyte pH. The over-potential for O2 evolution is

more important for LN600 than for LN750 in H2SO4 and

Na2SO4. When using glassy carbon [31] or Pt [32] electrodes,

the anodic limit due to di-oxygen evolution can be more or

less extended depending on the electrolyte pH. The highest

oxygen over-potential has been observed in neutral solu-

tions, with 0.7 or 0.5 V for glassy carbon or Pt electrodes,

respectively, while it reaches smaller values in acidic and ba-

sic media, e.g., 0.5 and 0.3 V for glassy carbon and 0.0 and

0.4 V for Pt, respectively. However, Fig. 2a (right) shows that,

in H2SO4, the oxidation of seaweed carbons takes place even

before reaching the thermodynamic limit for di-oxygen evo-

lution. This effect is shifted to a higher value for the more

functionalized LN600. In KOH, the difference between the

two materials is less marked (Fig. 2b, right). In Na2SO4, they

can be polarized at potentials higher than the equilibrium

potential for water oxidation, but the observed over-poten-

tials are not as high as for glassy carbon or Pt electrodes,

confirming that the nature of the electrode has an important

role. In this sense, a higher content of oxygenated surface

functionalities seems to favour a higher anodic limit. These

results fit with Biniak et al. [26,33] observations, showing

that a high oxygen content on the carbon surface ought to

protect it from uncontrollable oxidation during electrochem-

ical processes.

Taking into account the cathodic and anodic limits found

in the different electrolytes for the seaweed carbons, it results

clearly that the highest stability window can be attained in

neutral solution. As it has been reported for the particular

case of Pt [32], this property can be related to the fact that

the H+ and OH� concentrations in neutral electrolyte are too

low to induce gas evolution reactions.

In conclusion, the capacitance values and the stability po-

tential window are both controlled by the nature of the elec-

trode material and the electrolyte pH. The results exposed in

Fig. 2 show that when using oxygen-rich seaweed carbons as

electrodes, KOH or Na2SO4 can be good candidates for replac-

ing the well performing but corrosive H2SO4 electrolyte. In

particular, the large stability potential window of seaweed

based carbons in neutral electrolyte – around 2.4 V for

LN600 against 2 V for commercial activated carbons [24] – al-

lows predicting supercapacitors operating up to a high volt-

age with a high energy density. However, the potential range

of each individual electrode in a capacitor cell cannot be con-

trolled. Therefore, in Section 3.2.3, it will be measured vs a ref-

erence electrode, and the cycleability of two-electrode cells

will be investigated in order to determine the maximum oper-

ating voltage.

3.2.2. Two-electrode cells performance in 6 mol L�1 KOH
Fig. 3 shows the cyclic voltammograms of two-electrode

cells with LN600 and LN750 based electrodes in 6 mol L�1

KOH. Despite the smaller specific surface area of LN600 com-

pared to LN750, the former demonstrates a slightly higher

capacitance. This fact together with the less rectangular

shape of the CV for this capacitor confirm a higher pseudo-

faradic contribution for LN600, what is logic on the basis of

its richer surface functionality (Table 3).

The three-electrode cell CV presented in Fig. 2b suggest

that voltage values around 1.7 V (stability potential window

from �1.4 to 0.3 V vs NHE) and 1.4 V could be reached
for capacitors based on LN600 and LN750, respectively.

Galvanostatic cycling of the two-electrode cells has been

performed to assess the values of maximum voltage. Table 4

reports, for LN600 and LN750 based capacitors, the capaci-

tance values obtained after 10 and 5000 charge/discharge

cycles at 1 A g�1 up to different voltage values. After 10 cy-

cles up to 0.8–1.2 V, the capacitance values of the two mate-

rials are very similar, e.g., 160–170 F g�1. For comparison,

using the same conditions in 1 mol L�1 H2SO4, the capaci-

tance values are 180 and 220 F g�1 for LN750 and LN600,

respectively. The smaller capacitance value for LN600 in

KOH compared to H2SO4 is related to the already explained

less efficient pseudo-faradic contribution of oxygenated

surface functionalities in KOH medium [28].

For LN600, the capacitance loss after 5000 charge/dis-

charge cycles up to 0.8 V is 18% (Table 4), demonstrating that

0.8 V is already a too high voltage, even if the cyclic voltam-

metry investigations (Fig. 3) suggested that 1.4 V could be

reached. The capacitance decay may have two origins: (i) irre-

versible pseudo-faradic redox reactions and (ii) one of the two

electrodes operating out of the stability potential window

determined previously. In a two-electrode cell, the operating

potential range of each electrode cannot be controlled and,

beyond a given voltage, the potential of one of the electrodes

can surpass the stability limits.

By contrast, the capacitor built with the LN750 carbon is

able to operate up to 1.2 and 1.4 V with a capacitance loss of

only 11% and 14%, respectively, after 5000 cycles. In other

words, with this material, it is possible to take advantage of

almost all the stability window determined in three-electrode

configuration (see Fig. 2b). At 1.6 V, the capacitance decay is

very high (Table 4) because this voltage is wider than the sta-

bility window of LN750 in KOH, and one electrode or both

operate outside the stability window.

Whereas the oxygen rich LN600 seaweed based carbon

demonstrated excellent performance in 1 mol L�1 H2SO4
[16], this is no longer the case in 6 mol L�1 KOH, due to the

very low stability of the system during cycling. This phenom-

enon could be explained by an incomplete carbonization of

the precursor leaving some amount of raw biopolymers

Fig. 4 – Cyclic voltammograms (2 mV s�1) of LN600 and LN
non-carbonized, e.g., sodium alginate. This residual alginate

is dissolved in the presence of the alkaline electrolyte [34]

and the electrodes loose their integrity.

By contrast, with LN750 which contains a smaller amount

of oxygenated surface functionalities, cell voltages of 1.2–

1.4 V are attained in both H2SO4 and KOH media, with a good

cycle life. Consequently, KOH can be a suitable electrolyte for

high voltage seaweed carbon based supercapacitors in aque-

ous electrolyte, provided that the carbon electrode material

is carefully selected.

3.2.3. Two-electrode cells performance in 0.5 mol L�1 Na2SO4
Fig. 4 shows the two-electrode cell voltammograms of

LN600 and LN750 in 0.5 mol L�1 Na2SO4. Whereas the specific

surface area of the two carbons is different, the capacitance

values are quite similar for LN600 (125 F g�1) and LN750

(123 F g�1), because of their different surface functionalities.

The values found are comparable to those obtained in

three-electrode cell (Section 3.2.1).

Although Fig. 4 suggests that the LN600 and LN750 capac-

itors are able to operate up to 1.6 V, it is necessary to investi-

gate the evolution of capacitance during galvanostatic cycling

up to such voltage for claiming about a high stability of these

systems. Fig. 5 shows the capacitance values vs the number of

galvanostatic (1 A g�1) charge/discharge cycles up to 1.6 V for

the LN600 and LN750 based two-electrode cells in Na2SO4. In

both cases, after a small capacitance drop during the first cy-

cles, the values keep very stable during 10,000 cycles at 1.6 V.

For comparison purposes, Fig. 5 includes the data obtained

when cycling the LN600 and LN750 based supercapacitors at

their maximum stability voltage in 6 mol L�1 KOH, e.g., 0.8

and 1.2 V, respectively, and in 1 mol L�1 H2SO4, e.g., 1.2 and

1.0 V, respectively. In spite of the lower capacitance values ob-

tained in neutral electrolyte in comparison to the acidic or ba-

sic ones, the seaweed carbons based capacitors can be

reversibly charged/discharged at much higher voltage in

0.5 mol L�1 Na2SO4. Table 5 summarizes the values of specific

capacitance and maximum energy density for the LN600 and

LN750 based supercapacitors, at the maximum voltage for

Although 1.6 V is a very high voltage for a symmetric

as 2.4 V. In order to understand why such voltage value is not

reached in a symmetric capacitor, the potential window of

each electrode has been recorded while charging the cell up

to different voltage values. For this experiment, a Hg/Hg2SO4
reference electrode has been introduced in the cell. Fig. 6

shows the evolution of the potential measured at U = 0 V

(E0V) and of the extreme electrode potentials E
+ and E� vs var-

ious values of maximum voltage reached after the galvano-

static charge of supercapacitors based on LN600 and LN750.

When the supercapacitor built with LN600 is charged up to

U = 1.6 V, the positive electrode operates between 0.39 and

1.19 V vs NHE and the negative one between 0.39 and

�0.41 V vs NHE. For the supercapacitor built with LN750 elec-
trodes, in the same conditions, the positive electrode operates

between 0.34 and 1.07 V vs NHE and the negative one between

0.34 and �0.53 V vs NHE. From these data, when the voltage of
both capacitors reaches 1.6 V, the potential of the negative

electrode is only slightly under the thermodynamic limit for

water reduction, e.g., �0.38 V vs NHE. Consequently, one does
not take full advantage of the pseudo-capacitive response re-

lated with hydrogen electrosorption, and more important, the

entire stability window towards more negative potential val-

ues (see Fig. 2c) is underused. On the contrary, for the positive

electrode, the potential values are as high as 1.19 and 1.07 V

vs NHE for LN600 and LN750, respectively, while the theoreti-

cal value for water oxidation is 0.85 V vs NHE.

The anodic limit of the two materials was explored by

recording their cyclic voltammograms in three-electrode cell

up to very positive potential values (Fig. 7). The higher oxygen

content on LN600 surface seems to enhance its oxidation

resistance compared to LN750. While LN750 is extensively

oxidized at potential values slightly higher than 1.1 V vs

NHE (see the corresponding cathodic peak at around 0.45–

0.50 V vs NHE), oxidation of LN600 is negligible at such poten-

tial values. Nevertheless, it is clear that the potential reached

for the positive electrode in a LN600- or LN750-based superca-

pacitor charged up to 1.6 V is close to the one related to an

irreversible oxidation of carbon. Therefore, it can be con-

cluded that the maximum operating voltage of the capacitors

is actually limited by the positive electrode.

In summary, an exceptionally high voltage value of 1.6 V

was reached with a symmetric carbon/carbon capacitor in

Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte by using seaweed carbons. How-

ever, the offered possibilities of extending the negative elec-

trode potential towards more negative values could not be

fully exploited in this configuration.

4. Conclusion

Seaweed carbons have been electrochemically characterized

as electrode for supercapacitors in KOH, H2SO4 and Na2SO4
aqueous electrolytes. The nature of the electrode material

and the electrolyte pH influence both the capacitance values

and the stability potential window. For a particular electrolyte,

the carbon with the highest oxygen content demonstrates the

highest capacitance values and stability potential window. A

very high value of 2.4 V was observed for the stability potential

window of this carbon in Na2SO4 solution. Moreover, it has been

shown for the first time that a contribution of pseudo-faradic

reactions is possible in a neutral electrolyte if the material

posses an adequate surface functionality. In particular, the

quinone-like groups seem to be the most active ones.

It was demonstrated that a symmetric carbon/carbon cell

can operate up to 1.6 V in Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. This

performance shows that a neutral aqueous electrolyte is very

attractive for developing a new generation of environment

friendly carbon/carbon supercapacitors able to compete with

the organic electrolyte based systems.
