Activated carbons (ACs) were prepared by microwave-assisted heat treatment of petroleum

coke with KOH as activation agent, and characterized by infrared spectroscopy and nitro-

gen adsorption technique with the aim of studying the effect of activation time on the

properties of ACs for electrodes in electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs). The electro-

chemical properties of AC electrodes in EDLCs were studied by cyclic voltammetry, con-

stant current charge–discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results

show that the specific surface area (SBET) and total pore volume of ACs goes through a max-

imum as the activation time increases. At 35 min of the activation time, the as-made AC

(denoted as AC-35) has a SBET of 2312 m
2/g. With AC-35 as the electrode, its specific capac-

itance in EDLC at a current density of 50 mA/g can reach 342.8 F/g, and remains at 245.6 F/g

even after 800 cycles while the energy density of the capacitor remains at 8.0 Wh/kg. The

results have demonstrated that the microwave-assisted heat treatment is an efficient

approach to the preparation of ACs with high performance for EDLCs.

1. Introduction

The electric double layer capacitor (EDLC) is a new energy

storage device with high power density and long lifetime that

is better than traditional batteries [1], and has been used in

many fields such as mobile communication and electric vehi-

cles. EDLCs are based on electrochemical charge accommoda-

tion at the electric double layer and the occurrence of Faradic

reactions [2–6], of which the performance depends on the

electrode materials to a great degree. Activated carbons

(ACs) have been widely used as the EDLC electrode materials

because of its unique physicochemical properties, good con-

ductivity and low cost [3], which can be prepared from differ-

ent carbon sources by heat treatment and activation [7–11]. To

date, microwave-assisted heat treatment method has drawn

much attention because of its fast and uniform heating capa-

bility, which makes it possible to make ACs with high surface

area and well-developed porous structure, at the same time,

to consume less energy compared with the conventional heat

treatment methods. For ACs, their specific capacitance is usu-

ally proportional to their specific surface area. The ideal ACs

for EDLC electrodes are required to have a high surface area

and an optimal pore size distribution that are important to

high specific capacitance of EDLCs [12]. Here we report on

microwave-assisted KOH activation of petroleum coke for

preparing ACs with high performance for EDLCs. The effect

of activation time on AC properties has been systematically

studied in terms of the EDLC performance.

2. Experimental

2.1. Preparation and characterization of ACs

Petroleum coke (<74 lm in particle size) from Daqing oil field

of China was used as raw material to prepare ACs, of which

the proximate analysis and elemental analysis data are

shown in Table 1. Mad is the water content in petroleum coke

on the air dry basis, Ad is the ash content in petroleum coke

on the dry basis, and Vdaf is the content of volatile matter in

petroleum coke on dry and ash free basis.

For each run, the petroleum coke was first mixed with KOH

in a weight ratio of 1:5. The mixture was dried under vacuum

at 80 �C for 2 h to remove water, and then put in a corundum
crucible with a lid in which there was a small gas hole. The

crucible was surrounded by a cylindric Al2O3 fiber composite,

and heated in a LWMC-205-type microwave oven with an out-

put power of 250 W. The temperature of the sample in the cru-

cible was monitored by a thermal couple. The as-made ACs

were washed with deionized water till the pH of the washing

solution reached ca. 7, then dried at 120 �C for 2 h under vac-
uum before use.

The as-made ACs were characterized by Fourier transform

infrared spectrometry (FT-IR), and N2 adsorption technique.

Before the liquid N2 adsorption at 77 K, the ACs were degassed

at 250 �C in flowing N2 for 4 h under vacuum. For the as-made
ACs, the specific surface area was calculated using the BET

equation, the pore size distribution was determined by BJH

method, and the micropore size distribution was determined

by micropore analysis method and t-plot method, while the

total pore volume was assumed to be the liquid volume of ad-

sorbed N2 at a relative pressure of 0.99.

2.2. Preparation of AC electrode

The EDLC electrodes were made of ACs, carbon black (CB) and

poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE), in which AC was the base

material, and CB with a specific surface area of 550 m2/g (Ca-

bot-Corp., China) functioned as a conducting material. For a

typical run, the AC, CB and PTFE were mixed in a weight ratio

of 89:5:6, the mixture was pressed onto a foam nickel with a

size of 1.5 · 1.5 cm (the nickel foam functions as the current
collector), yielding electrodes with a height of ca. 0.6 mm

and with an active mass of ca. 120 mg. Before the EDLC test,

the electrodes were dried at 120 �C for 2 h under vacuum.

2.3. Electrochemical measurements of AC electrodes

The as-made AC electrodes were tested using cyclic voltam-

metry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in

an electrochemical workstation (CHI-760C, China). The test

cell was made of two electrodes, and tested in 6 M KOH and

LiOH mixture solution at a KOH/LiOH weight ratio of 50:1 with

a symmetrical cell configuration. Before the test, the cell was

soaked in the KOH/LiOH mixture solution for 1 h under vac-

uum. The capacitance behavior of AC electrodes was exam-

ined at a constant current discharge mode (LAND, CT-

2001A). The tests of the electrodes include stabilization at a

current density of 50 mA/g for 15 cycles under constant cur-

rent charge–discharge conditions, discharge at different cur-

rent density (20, 50, 100, 200 and 300 mA/g), and charge–

discharge at different current density (50, 100 and 200 mA/g)

as well as multi-cycle charge–discharge at a current density

of 50 mA/g.

3. Results and discussion

3.1. FT-IR analysis

Fig. 1 is the FT-IR spectra of ACs made in different activation

time, showing that there is not much difference in the surface

properties of the as-made ACs. The peak at 3440 cm�1 is due

to the –O–H stretching vibration, and the band at 2925 cm�1 is

due to the –C–H stretching. The peak at 1633 cm�1 is the char-

acteristic of –C@O stretching vibration of carbonyl groups
[13,14]. The peak at 1384 cm�1 is due to the –C–H stretching

vibration [15]. The band at 1117 cm�1 is due to the –C–O

stretching vibration. The weak peaks at 620 and 2297 cm�1

are difficult to assign though they are mentioned in the liter-

ature [16]. It should be noted that the peak intensity of –C@O
at 1633 cm�1 or –C–O at 1117 cm�1 for AC-31 sample is higher

than other samples, implying that the intensity of oxygen-

containing functional groups in the as-made ACs can be

tuned to some degree by changing the activation time.

3.2. Pore structure characterization

The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of ACs made in dif-

ferent activation time are shown in Fig. 2, showing that all

of the as-made ACs are microporous materials, evidenced

by the Type I isotherms. No obvious hysteresis loop can be

seen in the adsorption–desorption isotherms for all of the

as-made AC samples. When the relative pressure (P/P0) is be-

low 0.1, N2 adsorption increases quickly for all of the as-made

ACs. In the case of AC-35 sample, this trend continues till the

relative pressure reaches 0.2. The adsorption at lower pres-
roleum coke.

sure is indicative of micropore structure. The pore structure

parameters of ACs are summarized in Table 2.

Table 2 shows that for the as-made ACs, the SBET, Vt, Vmic
and Vmes+mac goes through a maximum as the activation time

increases from 27 to 37 min, respectively. For AC-35, its SBET is

2312 m2/g and its Vt is 1.13 cm
3/g, which is the highest among

the four AC samples. For all of the as-made ACs, their Vmic/Vt
ratio is in a range of 90.7–94.6%, further evidencing that the

as-made ACs are microporous. This demonstrates that micro-

wave-assisted heat activation can lead to ACs with high sur-

face area and large pore volume. This is also evidenced by
Table 2 – Pore structure parameters of ACs.

other reports about the microwave-assisted preparation of

ACs from different types of carbon sources [9,11].

Fig. 3 shows the variation of the activation temperature

with the microwave heating time. It can be seen from Fig. 3

that the activation temperature reaches 800 �C in 30 min,
and then levels off at 800 �C due to the limited output power
of the microwave oven used for the heat treatment. During

the activation step, the average heating rate is ca. 26.7 �C/
min. The quick rise in the temperature due to the microwave

heating makes it possible for the coke to be quickly yet effi-

ciently activated by reaction with KOH [17]. The chemical

reactions between carbons and KOH have been explained in

the literature [18]. Zhang et al. [19] once reported on the pro-

duction of oxygen-rich ACs from coal by KOH activation at

700 �C with a heating rate of 20 �C/min, yielding an AC with
SBET of 1950 m

2/g and Vt of 1.10 cm
3/g.

The effect of activation time on the pore volume of ACs is

shown in Fig. 4, showing that as the activation time increases,

the AC pore volume goes through a maximum at 35 min. For

the AC-35 sample, its micropore size varies in a range of 0.7–

1.1 nm.

3.3. Electrochemical characterizations

3.3.1. Cyclic voltammetry behavior of AC electrodes
Fig. 5 is the cyclic voltammetry curves of AC electrodes ob-

tained at a scan rate of 2 mV/s in 6 M KOH and LiOH aqueous

solution, showing that all sweep curves are symmetric on the

positive and negative sweeps, and the current at 0 V for elec-

trodes made of different ACs are different from each other.

The electrode made of AC-35 is the best among the four ACs

tested, evidenced by the high current and the almost ideal

standard rectangle. This is in good agreement with the large

SBET, Vmic and Vt of the AC-35 sample discussed above. With

the increase of the activation time from 27 to 35 min, the cyc-

lic voltammetry shape of AC electrodes becomes ideal square

cyclic voltammograms, indicating that the electric conductiv-

ity properties of AC are greatly improved. However, the cur-

rent of AC-37 electrodes decreases after the activation time

further increase to 37 min, as shown in Fig. 5, implying that

the electric conductivity properties of AC-37 electrode be-

come poor. Obviously, the electric conductivity of AC-35 is

the best among the four AC electrodes tested. This phenome-

non will be further discussed in Section 3.3.2. Rectangular

cyclic voltammetry shape of AC-35 electrodes implies a quick

dynamics and good charge propagation of AC-35 sample.

ear voltage–time dependence of AC-35 and AC-37 electrodes,

showing that the AC electrodes have the typical capacitive

behavior and good charge–discharge reversibility, which is

consistent with the cyclic voltammetry behavior of AC elec-
trodes shown in Fig. 5. The specific capacitance of the elec-

trode in EDLC can be calculated from the slope of the

discharge curve [20,21]. The specific capacitance of AC elec-

trodes measured at a current density of 100 mA/g after 17

times of discharge goes through a maximum with the in-

crease of activation time, which is 125.4 F/g for AC-27,

251.6 F/g for AC-31, 287.8 F/g for AC-35 and 270.3 F/g for AC-

37, respectively. It is known that for the EDLCs, their specific

capacitance is governed by the accessibility of aqueous solu-

tions to the micropores in ACs. In other words, the microp-

ores in ACs that N2 molecules can enter at 77 K would

function as space for the electro-adsorption of hydrated ions

in EDLCs [22,23]. In principle, the pores larger than 0.5 nm are

electrochemically accessible for aqueous solutions. In our

case, the high capacitance of AC-35 electrode (e.g. 287.8 F/g

for AC-35) in KOH and LiOH solutions is in proportion to its

large Vt (1.13 cm
3/g) and SBET (2312 m

2/g) measured by the

N2 adsorption. In general, specific capacitance of AC electrode

increases with surface area [24].

The equivalent series resistance (ESR) of AC electrode at

the discharge beginning can be calculated according to the

discharge curve [25]. The ESR of AC electrodes measured at

a current density of 100 mA/g after 17 times of discharge goes

through a minimum with the increase of activation time,

which is 24.4 Ω for AC-27, 19.4 Ω for AC-31, 1.2 Ω for AC-35
and 6.8 Ω for AC-37, respectively. In other words, the electric
conductivity properties of AC electrode go through a maxi-

mum with the increase of activation time. These results are

in good agreement with the rectangular cyclic voltammetry

shape of AC-35 electrodes in Fig. 5. The effect of cycle number

on the specific capacitance and ESR of AC-35 electrode at a

current density of 50 mA/g is shown in Fig. 7(a) and (b).

Fig. 7(a) shows that the specific capacitance of AC-35 elec-

trode decreases from 342.8 to 273.9 F/g after 100 cycles, and

then levels off at about 245.6 F/g with a capacitance retention

ratio of 71.6% after 800 cycles. The high specific capacitance

of AC-35 in KOH and LiOH solutions is also partly due to the

presence of LiOH in the KOH electrolyte. Varma and Rempe

[26] reported that the Li+ and K+ ions would strongly coordi-

nate with water molecules in aqueous solutions. For K+ ions,

the hydration number is 6, and for Li+, the hydration number

is 4; this is because the radius of K+ ion is bigger than that of

Li+ ion in aqueous solutions. The Li+ ions with smaller hydra-

tion number in LiOH electrolyte can move faster, and can

reach smaller pores in AC electrode than the K+ ions. This is

one of the reasons why better electrochemical performance

is observed in LiOH and KOH mixture electrolyte.

Fig. 7(b) shows that the ESR of AC-35 electrode does not

change much as the cycle number increases. Before 100 cy-

cles, the ESR of AC-35 electrode is ca. 1.0 Ω, and then increases
slowly and reaches 2.7 Ω after 800 cycles. This implies that
after repeated uses, the capacitors with AC as electrodes will

inevitably lose some capacitance, at the same time, the resis-

tance will increase to some degree [27].

For EDLCs made of AC-35 and AC-37, the energy density is

plotted against the power density of the capacitors, as shown

in Fig. 8(a). The energy density of capacitors is calculated

according to Eq. (1) [28].

It can be seen from Fig. 8(a) that the energy density of AC-

and as the power density increases, the drop of energy den-

sity for AC-35 capacitor is smaller than the AC-37 capacitor.

For the AC-35 capacitor, the retention ratio of energy density

is as high as 83.9% while in the case of AC-37 capacitor, it is

only 54.7%. The energy density of AC-35 capacitor remains

high at higher power density. This can be ascribed to the large

micropore volume (1.05 cm3/g, AC-35) for energy storage [30],

and the presence of some mesopore and macropore volume

(0.08 cm3/g, AC-35) for ion transport, i.e. mesopores and

macropores in ACs are helpful for the fast transportation of

The variation of the energy density of AC-35 capacitor with

the cycle number is shown in Fig. 8(b). For comparison, AC-35

was heated at 800 �C for 1 h under vacuum with an aim of
understanding the effect of heat treatment on the EDLC en-

ergy density and stability. Fig. 8(b) shows that the energy den-

sity of AC-35 capacitor drops from 11.6 to 9.3 Wh/kg after 100

decreases but slowly, and remains at 8.0 Wh/kg after 800 cy-

from 5.0 to 3.9 Wh/kg after 800 cycles with an energy reten-

tion ratio of 78.0% that is about 10% higher than the untreated

AC-35. This implies that the heat treatment can help improve

the stability of AC capacitor to some degree but with some

loss in energy density.

3.3.3. EIS of AC electrode
The impedance spectra of different AC electrodes are

shown in Fig. 9, in which the inset is the equivalent circuit

model of AC electrodes that is used to explain the character-

istics of EIS. The equivalent circuit model reveals that the

whole capacitor circuit is constituted by Rs, W, Rct, C and Q,

here Rs is the sum of the contact resistance and material

resistance (electrode materials, electrolyte and separator); W

is the Warburg resistance when the matter moves in solution,

exhibiting a line when the slope is 1; Rct is the resistance for

blocking ions from entering the pores of electrode materials,

and for blocking the movement of ions in solution and sepa-

rator; C and Q are capacitor layer formed in the charge–dis-

charge process. It can be seen that in comparison with

other AC electrodes, the AC-35 electrode has smaller value

that crosses with the real axis at 0.47 Ω, indicating that AC-
35 electrode has lower contact resistance and better conduc-

tivity than other three electrodes. At lower frequency range,

the curve for AC-35 is nearly vertical to the real axis, while

for AC-27 and AC-31, a large slope in the curve can be seen,

implies that it is difficult for the ions in electrolyte to enter

the pores of AC-27 and AC-31. In other words, the porous
ectrodes.

structure of AC-35 provides a better channel for the move-

ment of the ions.

The impedance data of different AC electrodes simulated

using ZSimpWin software are shown in Table 3. Double layer

capacitance is expressed as constant phase angle element (Q),

and n is the correction factor between 0 and 1. The square er-

ror (v2) for different impedance spectra of AC electrodes is rel-

atively small, ranging from 4.35 · 10�4 to 1.25 · 10�3,
evidencing that the equivalent circuit model adopted is cor-

rect in the present study. Table 3 also shows that the contact

resistance (Rs) for AC-35 is the smallest among the tested AC

electrodes, indicating the conductivity of AC-35 is the best.

For the AC-35 electrode, the W and Rct are also smaller than

that of AC-27 and AC-31, implying that the ion transport resis-

tance in the case of AC-35 is smaller.

Fig. 10(a) is Nyquist plot and Fig. 10(b) is the Bode plot of

AC-35 electrodes, in which both the measured (Msd.) and cal-

culated (Calc.) EIS data using ZSimpWin software according to

the equivalent circuit model in Fig. 9 are shown. It can be

clearly seen from Fig. 10(a) that the measured and calculated

EIS data for AC-35 electrode are in good agreement. Fig. 10(b)

shows that the phase angle is 70� (the ideal one should be 90�)
at lower frequency limitation, further evidencing the good

capacitive property of AC-35 electrodes.

4. Conclusions

High performance ACs for EDLCs are prepared by microwave-

assisted activation of petroleum coke with KOH as activating

agent. The influence of activation time on AC properties has

been addressed in terms of the pore structure and electro-

chemical properties of the ACs. It has been found that the SBET
and the Vt of ACs goes through a maximum as the activation

time increases, of which the SBET is 2312 m
2/g for AC-35 made

in 35 min of activation time. The specific capacitance of AC-35

electrode at a current density of 50 mA/g is 342.8 F/g, and

remains at 245.6 F/g even after 800 cycles with an energy

density of the capacitor being at 8.0 Wh/kg. The results dem-

onstrate that microwave-assisted activation technique is of

potential to make ACs with high performance in EDLCs be-

cause of its high efficiency, less time and low energy

consumption.
