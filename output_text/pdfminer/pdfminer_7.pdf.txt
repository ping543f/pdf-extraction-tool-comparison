properties of ACs for electrodes in electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs). The electro-

chemical properties of AC electrodes in EDLCs were studied by cyclic voltammetry, con-

stant current charge–discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results
show that the speciﬁc surface area (SBET) and total pore volume of ACs goes through a max-
imum as the activation time increases. At 35 min of the activation time, the as-made AC
(denoted as AC-35) has a SBET of 2312 m2/g. With AC-35 as the electrode, its speciﬁc capac-
itance in EDLC at a current density of 50 mA/g can reach 342.8 F/g, and remains at 245.6 F/g

even after 800 cycles while the energy density of the capacitor remains at 8.0 Wh/kg. The

results have demonstrated that the microwave-assisted heat treatment is an efﬁcient

approach to the preparation of ACs with high performance for EDLCs.

Introduction

The electric double layer capacitor (EDLC) is a new energy
storage device with high power density and long lifetime that
is better than traditional batteries [1], and has been used in
many ﬁelds such as mobile communication and electric vehi-
cles. EDLCs are based on electrochemical charge accommoda-
tion at the electric double layer and the occurrence of Faradic
reactions [2–6], of which the performance depends on the
electrode materials to a great degree. Activated carbons
(ACs) have been widely used as the EDLC electrode materials
because of its unique physicochemical properties, good con-

ductivity and low cost [3], which can be prepared from differ-
ent carbon sources by heat treatment and activation [7–11]. To
date, microwave-assisted heat treatment method has drawn
much attention because of its fast and uniform heating capa-
bility, which makes it possible to make ACs with high surface
area and well-developed porous structure, at the same time,
to consume less energy compared with the conventional heat
treatment methods. For ACs, their speciﬁc capacitance is usu-
ally proportional to their speciﬁc surface area. The ideal ACs
for EDLC electrodes are required to have a high surface area
and an optimal pore size distribution that are important to
high speciﬁc capacitance of EDLCs [12]. Here we report on

microwave-assisted KOH activation of petroleum coke for
preparing ACs with high performance for EDLCs. The effect
of activation time on AC properties has been systematically
studied in terms of the EDLC performance.

Experimental

2.1.

Preparation and characterization of ACs

Petroleum coke (<74 lm in particle size) from Daqing oil ﬁeld
of China was used as raw material to prepare ACs, of which
the proximate analysis and elemental analysis data are
shown in Table 1. Mad is the water content in petroleum coke
on the air dry basis, Ad is the ash content in petroleum coke
on the dry basis, and Vdaf is the content of volatile matter in
petroleum coke on dry and ash free basis.

For each run, the petroleum coke was ﬁrst mixed with KOH
in a weight ratio of 1:5. The mixture was dried under vacuum
at 80 (cid:3)C for 2 h to remove water, and then put in a corundum
crucible with a lid in which there was a small gas hole. The
crucible was surrounded by a cylindric Al2O3 ﬁber composite,
and heated in a LWMC-205-type microwave oven with an out-
put power of 250 W. The temperature of the sample in the cru-
cible was monitored by a thermal couple. The as-made ACs
were washed with deionized water till the pH of the washing
solution reached ca. 7, then dried at 120 (cid:3)C for 2 h under vac-
uum before use.

The as-made ACs were characterized by Fourier transform
infrared spectrometry (FT-IR), and N2 adsorption technique.
Before the liquid N2 adsorption at 77 K, the ACs were degassed
at 250 (cid:3)C in ﬂowing N2 for 4 h under vacuum. For the as-made
ACs, the speciﬁc surface area was calculated using the BET
equation, the pore size distribution was determined by BJH
method, and the micropore size distribution was determined
by micropore analysis method and t-plot method, while the
total pore volume was assumed to be the liquid volume of ad-
sorbed N2 at a relative pressure of 0.99.

2.2.

Preparation of AC electrode

The EDLC electrodes were made of ACs, carbon black (CB) and
poly(tetraﬂuoroethylene) (PTFE), in which AC was the base
material, and CB with a speciﬁc surface area of 550 m2/g (Ca-
bot-Corp., China) functioned as a conducting material. For a
typical run, the AC, CB and PTFE were mixed in a weight ratio
of 89:5:6, the mixture was pressed onto a foam nickel with a
size of 1.5 · 1.5 cm (the nickel foam functions as the current
collector), yielding electrodes with a height of ca. 0.6 mm
and with an active mass of ca. 120 mg. Before the EDLC test,
the electrodes were dried at 120 (cid:3)C for 2 h under vacuum.

2.3.

Electrochemical measurements of AC electrodes

The as-made AC electrodes were tested using cyclic voltam-
metry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in
an electrochemical workstation (CHI-760C, China). The test
cell was made of two electrodes, and tested in 6 M KOH and
LiOH mixture solution at a KOH/LiOH weight ratio of 50:1 with
a symmetrical cell conﬁguration. Before the test, the cell was
soaked in the KOH/LiOH mixture solution for 1 h under vac-
uum. The capacitance behavior of AC electrodes was exam-
ined at a constant current discharge mode (LAND, CT-
2001A). The tests of the electrodes include stabilization at a
current density of 50 mA/g for 15 cycles under constant cur-
rent charge–discharge conditions, discharge at different cur-
rent density (20, 50, 100, 200 and 300 mA/g), and charge–
discharge at different current density (50, 100 and 200 mA/g)
as well as multi-cycle charge–discharge at a current density
of 50 mA/g.

Results and discussion

3.1.

FT-IR analysis

Fig. 1 is the FT-IR spectra of ACs made in different activation
time, showing that there is not much difference in the surface
properties of the as-made ACs. The peak at 3440 cm(cid:2)1 is due
to the –O–H stretching vibration, and the band at 2925 cm(cid:2)1 is
due to the –C–H stretching. The peak at 1633 cm(cid:2)1 is the char-
acteristic of –C@O stretching vibration of carbonyl groups
[13,14]. The peak at 1384 cm(cid:2)1 is due to the –C–H stretching
vibration [15]. The band at 1117 cm(cid:2)1 is due to the –C–O
stretching vibration. The weak peaks at 620 and 2297 cm(cid:2)1
are difﬁcult to assign though they are mentioned in the liter-
ature [16]. It should be noted that the peak intensity of –C@O
at 1633 cm(cid:2)1 or –C–O at 1117 cm(cid:2)1 for AC-31 sample is higher
than other samples, implying that the intensity of oxygen-
containing functional groups in the as-made ACs can be
tuned to some degree by changing the activation time.

3.2.

Pore structure characterization

The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of ACs made in dif-
ferent activation time are shown in Fig. 2, showing that all
of the as-made ACs are microporous materials, evidenced
by the Type I isotherms. No obvious hysteresis loop can be
seen in the adsorption–desorption isotherms for all of the
as-made AC samples. When the relative pressure (P/P0) is be-
low 0.1, N2 adsorption increases quickly for all of the as-made
ACs. In the case of AC-35 sample, this trend continues till the
relative pressure reaches 0.2. The adsorption at lower pres-

sure is indicative of micropore structure. The pore structure
parameters of ACs are summarized in Table 2.

Table 2 shows that for the as-made ACs, the SBET, Vt, Vmic
and Vmes+mac goes through a maximum as the activation time
increases from 27 to 37 min, respectively. For AC-35, its SBET is
2312 m2/g and its Vt is 1.13 cm3/g, which is the highest among
the four AC samples. For all of the as-made ACs, their Vmic/Vt
ratio is in a range of 90.7–94.6%, further evidencing that the
as-made ACs are microporous. This demonstrates that micro-
wave-assisted heat activation can lead to ACs with high sur-
face area and large pore volume. This is also evidenced by

other reports about the microwave-assisted preparation of
ACs from different types of carbon sources [9,11].

Fig. 3 shows the variation of the activation temperature
with the microwave heating time. It can be seen from Fig. 3
that the activation temperature reaches 800 (cid:3)C in 30 min,
and then levels off at 800 (cid:3)C due to the limited output power
of the microwave oven used for the heat treatment. During
the activation step, the average heating rate is ca. 26.7 (cid:3)C/
min. The quick rise in the temperature due to the microwave
heating makes it possible for the coke to be quickly yet efﬁ-
ciently activated by reaction with KOH [17]. The chemical
reactions between carbons and KOH have been explained in
the literature [18]. Zhang et al. [19] once reported on the pro-
duction of oxygen-rich ACs from coal by KOH activation at
700 (cid:3)C with a heating rate of 20 (cid:3)C/min, yielding an AC with
SBET of 1950 m2/g and Vt of 1.10 cm3/g.

The effect of activation time on the pore volume of ACs is
shown in Fig. 4, showing that as the activation time increases,
the AC pore volume goes through a maximum at 35 min. For
the AC-35 sample, its micropore size varies in a range of 0.7–
1.1 nm.

Electrochemical characterizations

3.3.1. Cyclic voltammetry behavior of AC electrodes
Fig. 5 is the cyclic voltammetry curves of AC electrodes ob-
tained at a scan rate of 2 mV/s in 6 M KOH and LiOH aqueous
solution, showing that all sweep curves are symmetric on the
positive and negative sweeps, and the current at 0 V for elec-
trodes made of different ACs are different from each other.
The electrode made of AC-35 is the best among the four ACs
tested, evidenced by the high current and the almost ideal
standard rectangle. This is in good agreement with the large
SBET, Vmic and Vt of the AC-35 sample discussed above. With
the increase of the activation time from 27 to 35 min, the cyc-
lic voltammetry shape of AC electrodes becomes ideal square
cyclic voltammograms, indicating that the electric conductiv-
ity properties of AC are greatly improved. However, the cur-
rent of AC-37 electrodes decreases after the activation time
further increase to 37 min, as shown in Fig. 5, implying that
the electric conductivity properties of AC-37 electrode be-
come poor. Obviously, the electric conductivity of AC-35 is
the best among the four AC electrodes tested. This phenome-
non will be further discussed in Section 3.3.2. Rectangular
cyclic voltammetry shape of AC-35 electrodes implies a quick
dynamics and good charge propagation of AC-35 sample.

3.3.2. Charge–discharge behavior of AC electrodes

Constant current charge–discharge is conducted to mea-
sure the speciﬁc capacitance of AC electrodes. Fig. 6 is the lin-

trodes shown in Fig. 5. The speciﬁc capacitance of the elec-
trode in EDLC can be calculated from the slope of the
discharge curve [20,21]. The speciﬁc capacitance of AC elec-
trodes measured at a current density of 100 mA/g after 17
times of discharge goes through a maximum with the in-
crease of activation time, which is 125.4 F/g for AC-27,
251.6 F/g for AC-31, 287.8 F/g for AC-35 and 270.3 F/g for AC-
37, respectively. It is known that for the EDLCs, their speciﬁc
capacitance is governed by the accessibility of aqueous solu-
tions to the micropores in ACs. In other words, the microp-
ores in ACs that N2 molecules can enter at 77 K would
function as space for the electro-adsorption of hydrated ions
in EDLCs [22,23]. In principle, the pores larger than 0.5 nm are
electrochemically accessible for aqueous solutions. In our
case, the high capacitance of AC-35 electrode (e.g. 287.8 F/g
for AC-35) in KOH and LiOH solutions is in proportion to its
large Vt (1.13 cm3/g) and SBET (2312 m2/g) measured by the
N2 adsorption. In general, speciﬁc capacitance of AC electrode
increases with surface area [24].

The equivalent series resistance (ESR) of AC electrode at
the discharge beginning can be calculated according to the
discharge curve [25]. The ESR of AC electrodes measured at
a current density of 100 mA/g after 17 times of discharge goes
through a minimum with the increase of activation time,
which is 24.4 Ω for AC-27, 19.4 Ω for AC-31, 1.2 Ω for AC-35
and 6.8 Ω for AC-37, respectively. In other words, the electric
conductivity properties of AC electrode go through a maxi-
mum with the increase of activation time. These results are
in good agreement with the rectangular cyclic voltammetry
shape of AC-35 electrodes in Fig. 5. The effect of cycle number
on the speciﬁc capacitance and ESR of AC-35 electrode at a
current density of 50 mA/g is shown in Fig. 7(a) and (b).
Fig. 7(a) shows that the speciﬁc capacitance of AC-35 elec-
trode decreases from 342.8 to 273.9 F/g after 100 cycles, and
then levels off at about 245.6 F/g with a capacitance retention
ratio of 71.6% after 800 cycles. The high speciﬁc capacitance
of AC-35 in KOH and LiOH solutions is also partly due to the
presence of LiOH in the KOH electrolyte. Varma and Rempe
[26] reported that the Li+ and K+ ions would strongly coordi-
nate with water molecules in aqueous solutions. For K+ ions,
the hydration number is 6, and for Li+, the hydration number

is 4; this is because the radius of K+ ion is bigger than that of
Li+ ion in aqueous solutions. The Li+ ions with smaller hydra-
tion number in LiOH electrolyte can move faster, and can
reach smaller pores in AC electrode than the K+ ions. This is
one of the reasons why better electrochemical performance
is observed in LiOH and KOH mixture electrolyte.

Fig. 7(b) shows that the ESR of AC-35 electrode does not
change much as the cycle number increases. Before 100 cy-
cles, the ESR of AC-35 electrode is ca. 1.0 Ω, and then increases
slowly and reaches 2.7 Ω after 800 cycles. This implies that
after repeated uses, the capacitors with AC as electrodes will
inevitably lose some capacitance, at the same time, the resis-
tance will increase to some degree [27].

For EDLCs made of AC-35 and AC-37, the energy density is
plotted against the power density of the capacitors, as shown
in Fig. 8(a). The energy density of capacitors is calculated
according to Eq. (1) [28].

where C is the capacitance of the two-electrode capacitor (F),

The power density is calculated according to Eq. (2).

where I is the discharge current (mA) and m is the active mass
in the two-electrode capacitor (g).

It can be seen from Fig. 8(a) that the energy density of AC-
35 capacitor is consistently higher than the AC-37 capacitor,
and as the power density increases, the drop of energy den-
sity for AC-35 capacitor is smaller than the AC-37 capacitor.
For the AC-35 capacitor, the retention ratio of energy density
is as high as 83.9% while in the case of AC-37 capacitor, it is
only 54.7%. The energy density of AC-35 capacitor remains
high at higher power density. This can be ascribed to the large
micropore volume (1.05 cm3/g, AC-35) for energy storage [30],
and the presence of some mesopore and macropore volume
(0.08 cm3/g, AC-35) for ion transport,

made of AC-35 heated at 800 (cid:3)C, the energy density drops
from 5.0 to 3.9 Wh/kg after 800 cycles with an energy reten-
tion ratio of 78.0% that is about 10% higher than the untreated
AC-35. This implies that the heat treatment can help improve
the stability of AC capacitor to some degree but with some
loss in energy density.

3.3.3.

EIS of AC electrode

The impedance spectra of different AC electrodes are
shown in Fig. 9, in which the inset is the equivalent circuit
model of AC electrodes that is used to explain the character-
istics of EIS. The equivalent circuit model reveals that the
whole capacitor circuit is constituted by Rs, W, Rct, C and Q,
here Rs is the sum of the contact resistance and material
resistance (electrode materials, electrolyte and separator); W
is the Warburg resistance when the matter moves in solution,
exhibiting a line when the slope is 1; Rct is the resistance for
blocking ions from entering the pores of electrode materials,
and for blocking the movement of ions in solution and sepa-
rator; C and Q are capacitor layer formed in the charge–dis-
charge process. It can be seen that in comparison with
other AC electrodes, the AC-35 electrode has smaller value
that crosses with the real axis at 0.47 Ω, indicating that AC-
35 electrode has lower contact resistance and better conduc-
tivity than other three electrodes. At lower frequency range,
the curve for AC-35 is nearly vertical to the real axis, while
for AC-27 and AC-31, a large slope in the curve can be seen,
implies that it is difﬁcult for the ions in electrolyte to enter
the pores of AC-27 and AC-31. In other words, the porous

macropores in ACs are helpful for the fast transportation of

The variation of the energy density of AC-35 capacitor with
the cycle number is shown in Fig. 8(b). For comparison, AC-35
was heated at 800 (cid:3)C for 1 h under vacuum with an aim of
understanding the effect of heat treatment on the EDLC en-
ergy density and stability. Fig. 8(b) shows that the energy den-
sity of AC-35 capacitor drops from 11.6 to 9.3 Wh/kg after 100
cycles with an energy retention ratio of 80.2%, then further
decreases but slowly, and remains at 8.0 Wh/kg after 800 cy-
cles with an energy retention ratio of 68.8%. For the capacitor

structure of AC-35 provides a better channel for the move-
ment of the ions.

The impedance data of different AC electrodes simulated
using ZSimpWin software are shown in Table 3. Double layer
capacitance is expressed as constant phase angle element (Q),
and n is the correction factor between 0 and 1. The square er-
ror (v2) for different impedance spectra of AC electrodes is rel-
to 1.25 · 10(cid:2)3,
ranging from 4.35 · 10(cid:2)4
atively small,
evidencing that the equivalent circuit model adopted is cor-
rect in the present study. Table 3 also shows that the contact
resistance (Rs) for AC-35 is the smallest among the tested AC
electrodes, indicating the conductivity of AC-35 is the best.
For the AC-35 electrode, the W and Rct are also smaller than
that of AC-27 and AC-31, implying that the ion transport resis-
tance in the case of AC-35 is smaller.

Fig. 10(a) is Nyquist plot and Fig. 10(b) is the Bode plot of
AC-35 electrodes, in which both the measured (Msd.) and cal-
culated (Calc.) EIS data using ZSimpWin software according to
the equivalent circuit model in Fig. 9 are shown. It can be
clearly seen from Fig. 10(a) that the measured and calculated
EIS data for AC-35 electrode are in good agreement. Fig. 10(b)
shows that the phase angle is 70(cid:3) (the ideal one should be 90(cid:3))
at lower frequency limitation, further evidencing the good
capacitive property of AC-35 electrodes.

Conclusions

High performance ACs for EDLCs are prepared by microwave-
assisted activation of petroleum coke with KOH as activating
agent. The inﬂuence of activation time on AC properties has
been addressed in terms of the pore structure and electro-
chemical properties of the ACs. It has been found that the SBET
and the Vt of ACs goes through a maximum as the activation
time increases, of which the SBET is 2312 m2/g for AC-35 made
in 35 min of activation time. The speciﬁc capacitance of AC-35
electrode at a current density of 50 mA/g is 342.8 F/g, and
remains at 245.6 F/g even after 800 cycles with an energy
density of the capacitor being at 8.0 Wh/kg. The results dem-
onstrate that microwave-assisted activation technique is of
potential to make ACs with high performance in EDLCs be-
less time and low energy
