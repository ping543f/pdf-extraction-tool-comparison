Mesoporous carbons (MCs) with high surface area of 1527e1634 m2 g
from biomass such as peanut shell and rice husk by one-step zinc chloride (ZnCl2) activation assisted
with microwave heating. At higher current density, the MCs made by the microwave heating show both
higher energy and higher power density than the MCs made by the conventional heating because of
bigger average pore size and unique mesopore structure in the MCs made by the microwave-assisted
technique. It has been found that the supercapacitors made from the MCs by the microwave-assisted

1. Introduction

Supercapacitors are drawing much attention as a promising en-
ergy storage device [1]. Porous carbons including mesoporous car-
bons (MCs) and microporous carbons have been widely used as the
electrode materials of supercapacitors due to their high surface area.
However, some micropores in traditional porous carbons are not
limiting the formation of electric
accessible to the electrolyte,

110

double-layer to some degree [2]. Because of this, the speciﬁc
capacitance of microporous carbons drops at higher current density
while the MCs show better rate performance [3]. Traditionally, the
MCs are mainly produced by the template method [4], which is
tedious and not environmentally benign because the template
needs to be synthesized before use and be removed by strong acids
after the synthesis step. This results in a high production cost of the
template MCs. Recently we reported on the synthesis of MCs for
supercapacitors from coal tar pitch by coupling KOH activation with
MgO template [5]. In comparison to coal tar pitch, the abundant
biomass including peanut shell and rice husk is one of the promising
carbon precursors for preparing MCs, of which one of the key issues
is how to efﬁciently convert the biomass to the MCs with desired
mesopore structures for supercapacitors at low energy consumption
and environmental impact. It has been demonstrated that the
microwave-assisted heat-treatment has many advantages over the
conventional heating process [6,7] in terms of the quick and uniform
heating feature, and the low energy consumption [8]. Here we
report on a simple method to prepare MCs with well-developed
mesopore structure for supercapacitors from peanut shell and rice
husk by one-step microwave-assisted ZnCl2 activation.

2. Experimental

The peanut shell with an ash content of 1.44% on a dry basis (Ad)
was obtained from Huai-an in Jiangsu province. The rice husk was
obtained from Huai-xiang Company in Anhui province, and before
use it was deashed in 0.5 M NaOH solution at 343 K for 2 h under
constant stirring to decrease its Ad from 18.44% to 7.00%.

The peanut shell was washed using water and dried, then
crushed to a particle size of 3 (cid:4) 10 mm, and was impregnated in
ZnCl2 solution for 12 h with a mass ratio of ZnCl2/peanut shell of
4/1 while the total mass was kept at 27 g. The ZnCl2 solution was
made by dissolving 21.6 g ZnCl2 in 60 ml distilled water. The
ZnCl2-impregnated peanut shell was dried at 383 K for 24 h before
(cid:3)1e
being activated to make MCs at a heating rate of 5 K min
1123 K, and held at 1123 K for 1 h in ﬂowing nitrogen by con-
ventional heating [9]. This leads to MCs termed as PMC4/1-C, where
the subscript (C) refers to the conventional heating at a ZnCl2/
peanut shell mass ratio of 4/1. For comparison, MCs were also
made in 20 min by the microwave heating in a LWMC-205-type
microwave oven with a microwave power of 600 W [5], which
resulted in MCs termed as PMC4/1-M, where the subscript (M) re-
fers to the microwave heating. The MCs made from rice husk are
termed as RMC4/1-C and RMC4/1-M, respectively. Porous carbons
made from peanut shell and rice husk without ZnCl2 activation by
conventional heating are termed as PPC0-C and RPC0-C, respec-
tively. In the present study, we have found that porous carbons
cannot be made from dried peanut shell or rice husk without
ZnCl2 treatment by microwave heating because of the poor
adsorbing capacity of the dried biomass toward the microwave
energy [10]. The ash contents for all of the MCs are below 3.2%.
The pore structures of the as-made MCs were characterized using
nitrogen adsorptionedesorption isotherms [5].

Electrodes were made by pressing a mixture of 89 wt% MCs, 5 wt
(cid:3)1, and 6 wt%
% carbon black with a BET surface area of 550 m2 g
PTFE at 15.0 MPa for 10 s, which were dried at 383 K for 1 h under
vacuum before the test [5]. Button-type capacitor was assembled
with two carbon electrodes and a separator. For the 6 M KOH
electrolyte, the separator used was polypropylene membrane,
while for the 1 M Et4NBF4/PC electrolyte, the separator was TF4050.
The capacitors were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and
electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) by an electro-
chemical workstation (CHI-760C). The chargeedischarge perfor-
mance of capacitors was tested in a land cell tester (CT-2001A) at

(cid:3)1 [5] and by the
lower current density between 0.05 and 3.0 A g
supercapacitance test system (SCTS, Arbin Instruments, USA) at
(cid:3)1. The cutoff charge voltage for the
high current density of 20 A g
supercapacitors using 6 M KOH was set at (cid:3)0.5 to 0.5 V, while for
the 1 M Et4NBF4/PC electrolyte, it was set at 0e2.7 V.

3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a) is the nitrogen adsorptionedesorption isotherms of
MCs, PPC0-C and RPC0-C, showing clearly that the hysteresis loops
are present for all of the MCs, and only a few micropores are formed
in PPC0-C and RPC0-C without adding ZnCl2 to peanut shell or rice
husk. This has evidenced that the well-developed mesopores in
MCs made from peanut shell or rice husk can be attributed to the
activation of ZnCl2. The pore structure parameters of the MCs, PPC0-
C and RPC0-C in different yields are presented in Table 1. Kalderis
et al. reported that the ZnCl2 activation can produce porous carbons
(cid:3)1 by the conventional
with high BET surface area (SBET) of 750 m2 g
heating [7]. In our case, the SBET of PMC1/1-M, PMC2/1-M, PMC3/1-M,
PMC4/1-M and PMC5/1-M made by microwave-assisted ZnCl2 acti-
vation at different ZnCl2/peanut shell mass ratio are 1307, 1454,
(cid:3)1, respectively. The PMC4/1-M sample
1528, 1552 and 1409 m2 g
with the biggest SBET shows the highest energy density in 6 M KOH
aqueous electrolyte. The PMC4/1-M performance was further eval-
uated in 1 M Et4NBF4/PC electrolyte, which will be discussed below.
Fig. 1(b) is the pore size distribution of MCs, PPC0-C and RPC0-C,
in which the macropores are ignorable or poorly developed. The
pore size of PMC4/1-C and RMC4/1-C mainly centers at 1.0e2.0 and
2.0e10 nm, while for PMC4/1-M and RMC4/1-M, it centers at 1.2e2.0

and 2.0e30 nm, showing that the well-developed mesopores are
present. For PPC0-C and RPC0-C, the pore size centers at 0.7e0.8 and
1.0e1.2 nm, which are formed in the pyrolysis step of peanut shell
or rice husk. The SBET or yield of PPC0-C and RPC0-C is smaller than
that of PMC4/1-C and RMC4/1-C, illustrating that ZnCl2 has activated
the dehydration of peanut shell or rice husk, the degradation of the
carbon-containing structures, the charring and aromatization of
the carbon skeleton, leading to the creation and formation of more
porous structure in MCs. In a word, ZnCl2 has two functions, i.e.
good receptor of microwave energy and chemical activation agent
in the microwave-assisted heating. The PMC4/1-C and RMC4/1-C was

the microwave heating, the pore size of PMC4/1-M and RMC4/1-M is
bigger than that of PMC4/1-C and RMC4/1-C in both cases.

Fig. 2(a) and (b) are the EIS of MC electrodes in 1 M Et4NBF4/PC
electrolyte and in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte, respectively. All of
the MC electrodes have bigger contact resistance in 1 M Et4NBF4/PC
electrolyte than in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. At the high-
medium frequency, the MC electrodes show a depressed semi-
circle. The smaller the diameter of the semicircle, the lower the
charge transfer resistance. The smallest charge transfer resistance
in RMC4/1-M is due to its biggest mesopore size. At the lower fre-
quency range, the curve of RMC4/1-M electrode is nearly vertical to
the Z1 axis, showing that the improved capacitance behavior of
RMC4/1-M is due to its highest mesopore ratio as high as 99.0%.

Fig. 2(c) is the CV curves of MC electrodes at 2 mV s

(cid:3)1 scan rate.
The symmetric rectangular shapes of the CV curves imply a quick
ion diffusion and good charge propagation in all of the MC elec-
trodes at lower scan rate. Fig. 2(d) is the CV curves of MC electrodes
(cid:3)1 scan rate. It can be seen clearly that even at a high
at 100 mV s
(cid:3)1, an excellent symmetric rectangular shape
scan rate of 100 mV s
for the CV curves of the MC electrodes can be kept. In comparison
with the RMC4/1-M and PMC4/1-M samples, a large deviation from
the rectangular shape is observed in the case of the RMC4/1-C and
PMC4/1-C electrodes due to the limitation in charge transfer pro-
cesses at higher scan rate that possibly results from the narrow
micropores in the MCs made by the conventional way. Compared to
the RMC4/1-C and PMC4/1-C samples, the areas of CV curve of RMC4/1-
M and PMC4/1-M samples are bigger owing to the combining effect of
the bigger Dave and Vmes percentage as well as their smaller resis-
tance. The speciﬁc capacitance of the RMC4/1-C and RMC4/1-M in 1 M
(cid:3)1 and from
Et4NBF4/PC electrolyte decreases from 99 F g
(cid:3)1 with the discharge current density from
94 F g
(cid:3)1 (a current density increase by a factor of 60),
0.05 A g
respectively. This is comparable with the carbon that has a speciﬁc
(cid:3)1 in organic electrolyte
capacitance in a range of 80 F g
[11]. The chargeedischarge rate of MCs in 1 M Et4NBF4/PC elec-
(cid:3)1 is so quick
trolyte at higher discharge current density of 5e20 A g
that a few data during the discharge process can be recorded by the
latest SCTS tester. Hence, the speciﬁc capacitance of MCs in 1 M
Et4NBF4/PC electrolyte at higher discharge current density of 5e
20 A g

(cid:3)1 is not discussed in detail.

As for the 6 M KOH electrolyte, the variation of speciﬁc capaci-
tance of MCs with the current density is shown in Fig. 3(a). It is found
(cid:3)1 to
that the capacitance of RMC4/1-C electrode drops from 245 F g

68 F g
The capacitance retention of RMC4/1-C electrode is 27.8% while for
RMC4/1-M and PMC4/1-M, it is 31.2% and 56.1% because of the syner-
gistic effect of the bigger Dave, Vmes percentage and the smaller
resistance of MC electrode materials made by microwave heating.

(cid:3)1 to 0.83 Wh kg

The variation of the energy density of the MC capacitors with the
average power density is shown in Fig. 3(b). It is found that the
energy density of PMC4/1-C capacitor in 6 KOH electrolyte drops
(cid:3)1 with the increase of current
from 6.18 Wh kg
(cid:3)1 while for the PMC4/1-M capac-
density from 0.05 A g
(cid:3)1. The energy density
itor, it drops from 6.68 Wh kg
retention of PMC4/1-C capacitor is 13.4% while for the PMC4/1-M
capacitor, it is 16.5%. For the 1 M Et4NBF4/PC electrolyte at higher
discharge current density, the energy densities of the super-
capacitors made of MCs by microwave-assisted heating are higher
than the supercapacitors made of MCs by conventional heating. This
is obviously due to the bigger Dave of the MCs made by microwave-
assisted heating. The energy density of the RMC4/1-M capacitor in
(cid:3)1 to
1 M Et4NBF4/PC electrolyte drops from 23.4 Wh kg
(cid:3)1 with an energy density retention of 44.4%. The energy
10.4 Wh kg

density of the PMC4/1-M capacitor reaches 26.6 Wh kg

the MC capacitors in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte, which increases
by 2.5e3.4 times. This is also the case for the average power density.
For the MC capacitors in 1 M Et4NBF4/PC organic electrolyte, it in-
creases by 1.6e2.8 times than in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. The
results reported here have shown that the MCs with high perfor-
mance for supercapacitors can be made from peanut shell and rice
husk by microwave-assisted one-step ZnCl2 activation.

4. Conclusions

The MCs for supercapacitors have been made both from the
peanut shell and the rice husk by microwave-assisted one-step
ZnCl2 activation. At higher current density in 1 M Et4NBF4/PC
electrolyte, the MCs made by the microwave heating show both
higher energy and higher power density than the MCs made by the
