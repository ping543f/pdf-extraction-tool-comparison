<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">A hierarchical and highly porous carbide-derived carbon (CDC) was obtained by nanocasting of pre-ceramic precursors into cubic ordered silica (KIT-6) and subsequent chlorination.Resulting CDC replica materials show high methane and n-butane uptake and excellent performance as electrode materials in supercapacitors.
			
		
	
	
		
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">IntroductionA new class of ordered mesostructured carbon materials with high micropore content received considerable attention in the last decade due to their outstanding adsorption properties in combination with high chemical stability and good biocompatibility

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">2.3.Cubic ordered mesoporous silicon carbide by incipient wetness infiltration SiC-3 1.42 g of SMP-10 (Starfire Systems) and mass of DVB: 1.42 g of SMP-10 and 0.36 g of p-divinylbenzene (80% Sigma Aldrich) were drop-wise added to 2 g of above described KIT-6, and intensively mixed. Afterwards, the obtained mixture was evacuated over night at room temperature to obtain a homogeneous, quantitative pore filling. The pre-ceramic composite system was then pyrolyzed according to above described pyrolysis conditions at 1073 K.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">CharacterizationPrior to all adsorption measurements, the samples were degassed for 16 h at 473 K using the evacuation equipment of the adsorption devices. Nitrogen and hydrogen physisorption isotherms were measured at 77 K using a Quantachrome Autosorb 1C apparatus. Prior to the measurement, the samples were degassed in vacuum at 423 K for 24 h. Specific surface areas were calculated using the BET equation (p/ p 0 = 0.05-0.2). The pore size distribution was estimated according to the non-local density functional theory (NLDFT) equilibrium model for slit/cylindrical pores for CDC samples using the Autosorb 1.56 software from Quantachrome. The specific micropore volume was also calculated by above mentioned DFT model. Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments were performed on a Bruker Nanostar (sealed tube, Cu Ka; 1.5406 Å ) with a position sensitive HiStar detector. Samples for TEM analysis were prepared by dipping carbon coated copper grids into an ethanol suspension of CDC materials. TEM investigations were performed on a 200 kV-TEM FEI Tecnai T20 instrument. High pressure hydrogen adsorption measurements were performed at 77 K up to 135 bar on about 0.2 g sample. A high pressure volumetric BELSORP-HP apparatus was used to quantify the Gibbs excess amount of hydrogen adsorbed. The total volume of the empty vessel was determined via helium measurement at 298 and 77 K. Assuming that helium does not adsorb at 298 K, the sample volume and so called helium density of the sample are determined via helium measurement. A magnetic suspension balance (Rubotherm) was used to measure the difference in mass of samples deposited in a stainless steel sample holder, suspended within a high pressure vessel after pressure change.After the buoyancy correction of the experimental results related to the displacement of gas by the sample and sample holder (container), the adsorbed amount was calculated as described earlier

Replica carbons, received by HF treatment and chlorination at 1273 K for 3 h are abbreviated as CDC-1 and CDC-2, respectively (Table
