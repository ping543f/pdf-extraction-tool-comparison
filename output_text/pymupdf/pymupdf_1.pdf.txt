A series of high surface area activated carbon powders modiﬁed with various loadings of electroactive
anthraquinone groups was obtained by the spontaneous reduction of the corresponding in situ generated
diazonium derivative on activated carbon. The diazotation and grafting reactions are fast and efﬁcient
and by varying the stoichiometry of these reactions the grafting amount can be controlled. With appro-
priate reaction conditions, the attachment of anthraquinone groups allows to double the capacitance
of the modiﬁed carbonaceous material (195 F g−1) compared to the unmodiﬁed carbon (100 F g−1) due
to the contribution of the redox reaction of grafted anthraquinone molecules. Long time galvanostatic
charge–discharge cycling experiments were performed for composite electrodes prepared using modi-
ﬁed carbons having two different AQ loadings (e.g. 6.7 and 11.1 wt.%). Following 10 000 charge/discharge
cycles, only a 17% loss of the faradaic capacitance was observed for these two carbons. Thus, this hybrid
bifunctional material appears to be an excellent candidate for application as active electrode in electro-
chemical capacitors.

1. Introduction
In recent years, porous carbon materials have found applications
in electrical energy storage, particularly in electrochemical capac-
itor, an unique device which can store much more energy than a
conventional capacitor that can also offer much higher power den-
sity than batteries and capable of cycling millions of time [1,2].
These systems are based on the double layer capacitance (DLC) at
the electrode/electrolyte interface where electric charges accumu-
lated by the electrode surface are compensated by electrolyte ionic
species of opposite charge.
Activated carbons are promising electrode materials for electri-
cal double layer capacitors (EDLCs) because of their relatively low
cost and high speciﬁc surface area due to their microporous struc-
ture [4–10]. The relationship between their pore size distribution
and their electrochemical performances has been widely investi-
gated [2,3]. Until the recent ﬁndings on the role of ultramicropores
[5], it was believed that mesopores were the most convenient to
provide high speciﬁc capacitance to the carbon materials and sub-
sequently to increase their energy density.
Increasing the capacitance by optimization of the pore size dis-
tribution, i.e. with a growing amount of micropores and mesopores

ﬁnd some limitation due to activated carbon synthesis. Practically,
the useful surface area of activated carbon cannot be enhanced to
an inﬁnite value, which results in a maximum double layer capac-
itance contribution. Other approaches to increase the capacitance
of activated carbon are based on chemical surface modiﬁcation to
improve the wettability by the electrolyte [6–10] and induce redox
reaction with electrochemically active centers, such as nitrogen,
oxygen or phosphorus surface functional groups [11–15]. Another
attractive way is to add a faradaic contribution to the double
layer capacitance contribution. This can be done by preparing a
multifunctional electrode by mixing a faradaic material with acti-
vated carbon, but usually the faradaic material cannot sustain fast
charge/discharge rates neither long term cycling which is detri-
mental to the performance of the composite electrode compared
to standard activated carbon [16].
The covalent attachment of molecular species to surfaces by
electrochemical and spontaneous reduction of diazonium cations
has been widely investigated in the past two decades [17–26].
Among these, modiﬁcation with anthraquinone (AQ) groups has
found interest for several applications. Compton and coworkers
introduced and optimized the modiﬁcation of graphitic or glassy
carbon powder by chemical reduction of 1-diazo-anthraquinone
with H3PO2 [27], and used their material to develop a pH probe
[28]. AQ-modiﬁed electrodes were also investigated as electro-
catalysts for the electrochemical reduction of oxygen [29,30] and
also for electrochemical capacitor applications [31,32]. Pickup and
coworkers have reported a 40% increase of capacitance for an elec-

trochemical capacitor based on an anthraquinone modiﬁed carbon
fabric compared to pristine carbon fabric [32].
In this work, AQ groups were grafted at the surface of a
high surface area activated carbon (≈1500 m2 g−1). The grafting
was performed via the spontaneous reduction of a diazo-
nium derivative of AQ by the carbon powder in acetonitrile.
The diazonium cations were formed in situ by reaction of 1-
aminoanthraquinone with terbutylnitrite. By varying the reaction
conditions, the AQ loading was modulated and controlled. The
aim of this article is to determine the energy storage proper-
ties (e.g. speciﬁc capacitance) of several modiﬁed carbons from
cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge experi-
ments in an H2SO4 electrolyte. The cycling rate and long-term
cycling stability of AQ-modiﬁed carbon based electrodes were also
investigated.
2. Experimental
2.1. Reagents
Black Pearls 2000 was obtained from the Cabot Corporation
(named BP in the following sections), 1-aminoanthraquinone and
tert-butylnitrite (90% solution in acetonitrile) were purchased from
Aldrich.
Unless otherwise stated all reagents were obtained from Aldrich
and were used without further puriﬁcation. All solutions and subse-
quent dilutions were carried out using deionised water (Barnstead
Nanopure II).
2.2. Carbon modiﬁcation
In a solution of amino-anthraquinone (AAQ) in degassed ace-
tonitrile (for 150 ml of solvent: 192 mg, 0.1 equiv. compared to
carbon) was injected the same quantity of tert-butylnitrite (1 equiv.
compared to AAQ) after the complete dissolution of the amino
derivative. The mixture was stirred for 30 min and 100 mg of acti-
vated carbon was added. Then, each 30 min, another 1 equiv. of
tert-butylnitrite, was added directly to the organic suspension
which was kept at ambient temperature while stirring under N2.
The conditions of grafting (stoichiometry and total time of reac-
tion after the addition of the carbon powder) are summarized in
Table 1. The reaction mixture was ﬁnally vacuum ﬁltered on a
nylon ﬁltration membrane having a pore size diameter of 0.47 �m
(Pall) and the carbon powder washed by successive aliquot of ace-
tonitrile, DMF, acetone and methanol and dried under vacuum
for 12 h.
2.3. Electrode preparation, electrochemical experiments
conditions
The working electrode consists of a composite electrode pre-
pared by mixing, in a small volume of ethanol, the modiﬁed
activated carbon and PTFE as binder in a 95:5 wt.% ratio until a
homogenized paste-like consistency was obtained. The paste was
cold rolled and a small square of approximately 0.25 cm2 in size
and 2 mg in weight was placed in a stainless steel grid (80 mesh,
0.127 mm, Alfa Aesar) used as current collector and was pressed for
60 s at 0.9 MPa. A three-electrode conﬁguration was used in a one-
compartment cell for the electrochemical characterization of the
single activated carbon electrode. The counter electrode consists of
a 20 × 60 mm piece of carbon graphite paper placed at 20 mm of
the working electrode with a Ag/AgCl reference electrode placed
at 5 mm of the working electrode. Degazed aqueous sulfuric acid
(0.1 M) was used as electrolyte in all experiments which were per-
formed at room temperature. All potentials are referred to Ag/AgCl
electrode. Prior to any measurement, the working electrode was
dipped in the electrolyte for 20 min in order to allow the electrolyte
to impregnate the electrode porosity.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out using a potentiostat
electrochemical interface SI480 (Solartron Instruments) and the
electrochemical setups were controlled with DC Corrware software
(Scribner Associates, version 2.8d). The gravimetric capacitance C
expressed in farads (F) per gram of paste material (carbon mod-
iﬁed by anthraquinone and PTFE) and the charge induced by
anthraquinone (for the determination of the amount of grafting)
was estimated by voltammetry at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Electrochemical behavior of the modiﬁed carbons
3.1.1. Amount of grafted anthraquinone
Fig. 1 shows the electrochemical response of electrodes made
with the modiﬁed carbons that is characterized by a rectangular
shaped cyclic voltammogram (CV) in 0.1 M H2SO4, due to capacitive
behavior of the carbon surface, completed by the reversible redox
waves for the anthraquinone groups centered at about −0.2 V. The
unmodiﬁed carbon only shows the rectangular CV. The changes of
the CV following grafting of AQ are similar to those reported for
a carbon fabric electrode (Spectracarb 2225) [33]. The additional
redox waves between 0 and 0.3 V can be tentatively attributed to
the redox processes of the molecules whose oxygen functionali-
ties are involved in hydrogen bonding between two closely-spaced
molecules. Those molecules are oxidized at a more positive poten-

tial because of their stabilized exchanged protons. By integrating
the anodic or cathodic redox waves and knowing that the redox
process of AQ involves two protons and two electrons (Eq. (1)), the
amount of grafted anthraquinone was estimated with slow (e.g.
2 mV s−1) scan rate CV.

The AQ loading of the electroactive materials are gathered in
Table 1 and ranged from 0.8 to 14 wt.%. In this study, the effect of
various parameters such as the reaction time, amine concentration,
amine/TBN ratio and their concentration on the AQ loading was
investigated.
The study of the inﬂuence of grafting time (see Table 1, carbons
BP1–BP4) revealed that the reaction is very fast and efﬁcient since
it has no considerable effect on the amount of grafted AQ for reac-
tion time longer than 5 min. Similarly, Pickup and coworkers have
shown that the spontaneous reduction of a commercially available
diazonium salt of AQ, Fast red Al Salt (C14H7ClN2O2–0.5ZnCl2) by
the activated carbon Vulcan XC72 in a hypophosporous acid solu-
tion (50 wt.%) yielded a complete grafting after 30 min [34]. They
observed the same coverage of 6 × 10−5 mol g−1 with reaction time
of either 30 min or 24 h. In this work we have observed that it is
only by modifying the stoichiometry of the reactions (diazotiza-
tion and grafting) that the amount of grafted AQ can be changed, as
shown in Table 1. Indeed, increasing the amine and the diazotiza-
tion agent concentrations, while keeping the same ratio for the two
reactants, allow to increase the AQ loading (compare samples BP5
and BP2). Furthermore, the grafting becomes much more efﬁcient
and increased by a factor close to 2 when the concentration of the
diazotization agent is doubled (BP2 and BP6). Thus, the diazotation
reaction is optimized with an excess of TBN. Furthermore, when
both the amine and diazotization agent concentrations, as well as
the TBN/amine ratio are increased, a high AQ loading of 14 wt.%
can be achieved. Finally, it is interesting to note that some AQ is
present at the BP surface even if the diazotization agent is not used.
This could be due to the adsorption of the 1-aminoanthraquinone
molecules at the surface [34] or spontaneous reaction of the amine
with the carbon [35].

dashed curve represents the double layer capacitance relative to the Black Pearls
content of the modiﬁed materials.
It is interesting to mention that other approaches have been
tested to inﬂuence and increase the amount of grafted molecules
by the diazonium chemistry. For example, Compton and cowork-
ers investigated the role of hypophosphorous acid as the reducing
agent for the covalent derivatization of graphite, carbon nanotubes
and glassy carbon materials [27]. They found that in the absence
of a reducing agent, the derivatization mechanism likely proceeds
via a cationic intermediate, whilst in the presence of hypophospho-
rous acid (in sufﬁcient quantities) the mechanism proceeds through
either a purely radical intermediate. In the presence of the reduc-
ing agent, the surface coverage of AQ groups reaches a maximum
at about 20 ◦C (probably due to the increasing rate of competing
side reactions beyond this temperature) whereas it continues to
increase until 40 ◦C when no hypophosphorous acid is used. Pickup
and coworkers also investigated the effect of the addition of H3PO2
to the reaction mixture and found a 50% decrease of the AQ load-
ing in the presence of this reducing agent [34]. On the other hand,
a preliminary treatment of the carbon surface (e.g. crushing, oxi-
dation by HNO3, heating at 700 ◦C under N2, reduction by NaBH4)
yielded a variation in the amount of the grafted AQ molecules by a
factor of 2 for the resulting modiﬁed carbons [32]. A similar obser-
vation has been made for the grafting of 4-nitrobenzene groups on
Vulcan although the variation of the surface coverage was smaller
diazonium cations [22]. Thus, the spontaneous reduction of the
diazonium cation appears generally as a very fast reaction, that is
only slightly inﬂuenced by a pretreatment of the carbon material
[22,34] and that the grafting rate appears to be more limited by the
diazonium formation (see Table 1).
The AQ loadings on BP carbons (Table 1) vary over an order of
magnitude and can reach 14 wt.% and compare well with litera-
ture data. It is interesting to note that a 7 to 10 wt.% loading was
achieved on high surface area carbon fabric (Spectracarb 2225) [32].
As expected, for the lower surface area Vulcan which is charac-
terized by a BET surface area of about 225 m2 g−1, a much lower
loading of about 2 wt.% (1 × 10−4 mol g−1) was reached.
3.1.2. Capacitance of the modiﬁed carbons
The contribution of the capacitive and faradaic processes to the
total capacitance of the modiﬁed carbons were determined from
the cyclic voltammogram (see Section 2) recorded in 0.1 M H2SO4
at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 and are reported in Table 1 and Fig. 2.
Table 1 shows that the double layer capacitance remains relatively

constant up to a grafting of about 7 wt.%. Further increase of the AQ
loading led to a decrease of the double layer capacitance. Fig. 2 also
shows the variation of the double layer capacitance of the carbon
substrate by considering only the fraction of carbon in the modiﬁed
materials. As expected, the evolution of the double layer capaci-
tance is similar albeit the relative decrease is slightly smaller. A
detailed investigation of the effect of AQ grafting on the double
layer capacitance has been reported elsewhere [36]. Brieﬂy, in the
latter, it has been shown that the covalent attachment of the AQ
groups resulted in a major loss of the microporosity, with pores
smaller than 0.65 nm being mainly blocked. The contribution to
the double layer capacitance of these small pores was estimated
to only 0.9 �F cm−2 [36]. This low value can explain why the dou-
ble layer capacitance is not strongly affected up to a AQ loading
of 7 wt.%, in agreement with previous studies that have shown that
the capacitance of carbide derived carbons drastically decreased for
calibrated pore size smaller than 0.8 nm [5d]. Interestingly, the con-
tribution of the faradaic process associated to the anthraquinone
redox interconversion increases linearly with the AQ loading in
the range investigated. Thus, the capacitance of the multifunctional
system can be signiﬁcantly increased, as a result of the contribu-
tion of the AQ redox process and to the fact that the double layer
capacitance contribution of the carbon is only slightly affected by
the AQ grafting. Fig. 2 and Table 1 show that the total capacitance
of BP increased from 100 to 195 F g−1 following AQ grafting up to a
loading of 14 wt.%. On the other hand, Pickup and coworkers have
shown that the capacitance of the AQ modiﬁed Spectracarb 2225
is 482 F g−1 when averaged between 0 and −0.25 V for an AQ mass
loading of 7 wt.% [32]. This contribution is added to the double layer
capacitance of the carbon fabric, which was 199 F g−1. Thus, the
contribution of the grafted AQ molecules to the total capacitance
is about 280 F g−1. This is comparable to the enhancement of the
capacitance of 240 F g−1 that could be computed from the data of
Table 1 for an AQ-modiﬁed BP carbon of 6.7 wt.%, when also average
over a potential range of 250 mV.
3.1.3. Cycling rate
Fig. 3 displays the scan rate dependence of the capacitance (total,
double layer and AQ) of various AQ grafted carbon electrodes. As
expected, the three different capacitances decreased with the scan
rate. Fig. 3(a) demonstrates that the cycling rate of the AQ-BP elec-
trode with an AQ loading of 11.1 wt.% is similar to that of the
unmodiﬁed carbon, indicating good kinetics for the redox processes
of the surface bound AQ molecules. The decrease of the total capac-
itance is much more important for the highest AQ loaded electrode
and at high scan rate, the total capacitance of this electrode even
becomes smaller than that of the lower (11.1 wt.%) AQ-loaded elec-
trode. This is mainly due to the loss of a signiﬁcant fraction of the AQ
signal in the electrochemical window used for the CV experiment,
which is limited at the negative potential extremity by the forma-
tion of H2. Actually in this case, only the total capacitance can be
reliably evaluated and accordingly the AQ and double layer capaci-
tances are not included in Fig. 3(b and c). Nonetheless, the fact that
for a 14 wt.% loading the capacitance of BP is twice as large relative
to the unmodiﬁed carbon at slow scan rate suggests that these high
AQ loaded electrodes could be used for low rate applications.
A close examination of the data of Fig. 3(b and c) revealed some
interesting features. The double layer and AQ capacitances for the
11.1 wt.% loaded BP decreased both monotonously with the scan
rate. This is to be contrasted with the sharp decrease of the double
layer capacitance for the unmodiﬁed BP. This has been discussed in
detail elsewhere and is due to the fact that a fraction of the microp-
ores, which contributes to the double layer capacitance, is blocked
by the grafted AQ molecules [36]. As a result, the total capacitance
of the 11.1 wt.% AQ loaded electrode is 1.6 time higher than that
of pristine BP at low scan rate (2 mV s−1), while at faster scan rate
(20 mV s−1) an attractive gain of 100% of the capacitance is observed
and this advantage is kept even at 100 mV s−1. A decrease of the
total capacitance has been also observed for AQ-modiﬁed carbon
fabric upon increasing the scan rate but the extent of the decrease
was not mentioned [32].
3.2. Electrochemical stability of the modiﬁed carbons
The
cycling
stability
of
an
electrochemical
capacitor
is
a key parameter and was investigated by constant current
charge/discharge cycling experiments. These measurements were
performed under relatively low (2 A g−1 of active material) and
high (10 A g−1) rate conditions and Fig. 4(a and b) presents typical
potential–time plots recorded for an AQ-modiﬁed carbon electrode
with a 11 wt.% AQ loading. The ﬁrst charge curve at 2 A g−1 shows a
quasi linear decrease between 0.4 and −0.15 V which corresponds
to the double layer region of the carbon electrode and that is fol-
lowed by a sloped plateau (centered at about 0.2 V) associated to the
reduction of the AQ grafted groups. Following the complete reduc-
tion of the AQ molecules, another short linear region is observed.
During discharge, the reverse processes are occurring with the
observation of the two linear regions and the sloped plateau, which
appears at a slightly more positive potential, in agreement with
the cyclic voltammetry data (Fig. 1). It is worth noting that the AQ
contribution (between −0.3 and −0.5 V) is clearly observed even
at a relatively higher current density of 10 A g−1 (Fig. 4(b)). In addi-
tion, at this higher charge/discharge rate, the shape of the discharge
curve slightly changes with a very fast decrease from 0.5 to 0.1 V
attributed to the resistive character of the electrode. This is fol-
lowed by a linear decrease corresponding to the contribution of
the double layer. At such a high rate, the charge and discharge steps
occur in 11 s and the second double layer contribution observed at
slower rate is not detected because the reduction of AQ groups is
not complete between −0.3 and −0.5 V. These differences observed

at these two cycling rates are in agreement with the CV data (vide
supra).
The evolution of the capacitance (total, double layer and AQ) of
BP modiﬁed with two different loadings of AQ during 10 000 con-
stant current charge/discharge cycles is shown in Fig. 4(c and d).
A decrease of the total capacitance is noticed during the ﬁrst 2000
cycles and is mainly due to the loss of the AQ redox waves as the
double layer capacitance contribution is barely affected. This phe-
nomenon is ampliﬁed when the AQ loading is increased. During the
subsequent cycles, the decrease is much less important and after
10 000 charge/discharge cycles, both electrodes lost approximately
17% of their faradaic capacitance (Fig. 4(c and d)). Since the grafting
loadings are different, this loss translates in total capacitance fade
of 10 and 14% for 6.7 and 11 wt.% AQ-loaded electrodes, respec-
tively. It is interesting to note that AQ is affected in a similar way,
independently of the AQ loading. After the initial capacitance loss
observed during the ﬁrst 2000 cycles, the fade appears to be approx-
imately the same, independently of the grafting amount (1.3% of the
AQ capacitance per 1000 charge/discharge cycles for the two elec-
trodes with a current density of 10 A g−1). By assuming that the rate
of the loss will remain constant upon further cycling, the lifetime
of such modiﬁed electrodes (before its capacitance has attained the
initial value, i.e. the one for the pristine carbon) could be estimated
to about 84 000 cycles.
Even if both electrodes still exhibit higher capacitance compared
to the pristine carbon electrode even after 10 000 cycles, it is rel-
evant to understand the cause of the loss of the AQ redox waves
because the decrease of the performance of the AQ-modiﬁed BP
electrode is mainly due to the organic molecules. Firstly, the ini-
tial decrease of capacitance observed during the ﬁrst 2000 cycles
can be due to the loss of AQ species that are only physisorbed to
the carbon surface. In a recent study, it has been clearly demon-
strated that adsorbed species can account for at least 50% of the
species immobilized at the surface of carbon powder [34]. These
adsorbed AQ moieties can be effectively removed by washing with
benzene. In our work, the washing method that was used to extract
the adsorbed molecules consisted of using several liters of different
organic solvents (acetonitrile, DMF, acetone and methanol) until
complete decoloration of the ﬁltrate. At the beginning of the wash-
ing procedure, the ﬁltrate was dark brown, especially with DMF. At
the end, a ﬁnal washing with DMF by sonication for 30 min yielded
a colorless solvent. Thus, we believe that this procedure is efﬁcient
to dissolve most of the absorbed AQ molecules. Secondly, degrada-
tion of the AQ molecules might also occur. This can be demonstrated
by cycling experiments performed at a lower scan rate. For exam-
ple, the decrease of AQ capacitance when the cycling was carried
out at 2 A g−1 (instead of 10 A g−1 in Fig. 4(c and d)), is higher and
reaches 55%. As a result the total capacitance will decrease by about
30%. The pronounced loss of capacitance at slower rate can be
explained by the fact that in this case the electrodes stay longer
at the extreme potential values, which is presumably harmful for
the grafted organic species.
These results suggest that AQ grafting is an interesting approach
to improve the capacitance of a carbon electrode. However, the
stability of the grafted AQ molecules will have to be improved.
Furthermore, to develop a more advanced two-electrode elec-
trochemical capacitor, a similar grafting could be performed to
increase the capacitance of the positive electrode. This could be
achieved by selecting an appropriate molecule that is characterized
by a more positive redox potential.
4. Conclusion
The speciﬁc capacitance of a high surface area activated carbon
was doubled by grafting AQ groups at its surface. With such car-
bon good performances are maintained during long-term cycling
and high current density charge–discharge cycling. However, the
grafted carbon exhibits a progressive loss of the electroactivity

associated to the grafted species, which will have to be limited if the
materials are going to be used in practical electrochemical capaci-
tors. Nevertheless, AQ grafted activated carbon opens the way for
the design of improved electrodes for electrochemical energy stor-
age devices. Future work will aim at ﬁnding an equivalent to AQ
for the positive carbon electrode in order to improve the overall
capacitance of the device.
