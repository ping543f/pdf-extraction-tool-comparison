Carbon-based micro-supercapacitors dedicated to energy storage in self-powered modules were fabri-
cated with inkjet printing technology on silicon substrate. An ink was ﬁrst prepared by mixing an activated
carbon powder with a PTFE polymer binder in ethylene glycol stabilized with a surfactant then deposited
by inkjet on patterned gold current collectors with the substrate heated at 140 ◦C in order to assure a
good homogeneity.
Electrochemical micro-capacitors with electrodes in an interdigital conﬁguration were fabricated, and
characterized using electrochemical techniques in 1 M Et4NBF4 propylene carbonate electrolyte. These
micro-devices show an excellent capacitive behavior over a wide potential range of 2.5 V for a cell capac-
itance of 2.1 mF cm−2. The newly developed technology will allow the integration of the storage device
as close as possible to the MEMS-based energy harvesting device, minimizing power losses through
connections.

1. Introduction
The
development
of
autonomous
electronic
miniaturized
devices has lead to an increasing demand for rechargeable micro-
power sources of appropriate size. Li and Li-ion micro-batteries
have been developed for this purpose in the late 1990s [1,2]. On
the other hand, harvesting micro-devices extracting energy from
various ambient environment sources (thermal, mechanical, solar
energy) have started to be developed in the year 2000 leading to
self-powered systems [3–5]. The harvested energy may be stored in
micro-batteries [6,7], but their ﬁnite life-time may be a major prob-
lem when they have to be embedded in permanent structures, such
as biomedical implants [8], active Radio Frequency Identiﬁcation
(RFID) tags [9] and structure-embedded micro-sensors where no
maintenance or replacement is possible [10]. Moreover, the quite
low power densities of rechargeable batteries remain insufﬁcient
for some speciﬁc applications or power harvesting devices.
Electrochemical capacitors (ECs), also called supercapacitors,
store energy using accumulation of ions at the interface between
a highly porous electrode and an electrolyte. The charge storage
mechanism is mainly capacitive, with no chemical modiﬁcation
of the electrode involved during the charge/discharge process.
As a result, they can sustain millions of cycles, can provide fast

charge/discharge rates and subsequently high power density, while
keeping a reasonable energy density [11,12]. EC miniaturized
to a microscopic scale could satisfy in this sense a variety of
micro-power demands and complement or replace micro-batteries
in electrical energy storage and harvesting applications where
high power delivery or uptake pulses are required in very short
times.
Very little work has been published on the integration of low-
proﬁle supercapacitors on a chip, although the applications are
there: local power sources for Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems
(MEMSs) devices, intermediate storage level for energy harvesting
microsystems and numerous sensors.
Micro-supercapacitors based on pseudocapacitive materials
have been reported in literature with interdigital ﬁngers as low
as 50 �m [13,14]. Unfortunately, the operating voltage range of
these devices using hydrogel-polymer electrolyte hardly exceeds
1 V [15], making them non-functional for most applications.
Yoon et al. have investigated the use of a pseudocapacitive
amorphous RuO2 electrode with a LiPON solid electrolyte for the
elaboration of a thin-ﬁlm micro-supercapacitor [16,17]. Despite
the use of Li+ ions instead of protons H+ intercalation in RuO2
electrode, they obtained a good capacitance and a high potential
window.
Unlike pseudocapacitive materials, carbon-based active materi-
als exhibit true capacitive behavior and excellent chemical stability
upon cycling [18]. Ho et al. have developed a 5 mm × 5 mm
carbon EC using a direct write pneumatic dispenser printer

[19]. They obtained a cell capacitance of 0.1 mF cm−2 for a
2 V potential range, despite the use of carbon of low surface
area.
The ﬁrst microstructured carbon-based EC was reported by
In et al. with an electrode area of 350 �m × 350 �m using the
OrigamiTM process [20]. Their micro-EC displays a cell capacitance
of 0.4 mF cm−2 for a 0.6 V potential range using aqueous electrolyte.
The use of hydrogel-polymer electrolyte for the elaboration of
all solid-state thin-ﬁlm carbon-based EC has also been reported by
Kaempgen et al. with an estimated cell capacitance of 1.1 mF cm−2,
but a potential window limited to 1 V [21].
In the present work, a new process based on the inkjet printing
technology is presented to integrate a microstructured carbon-
based EC of high surface area on silicon with very few technological
steps. The inkjet deposition technology has been developed for
polymers [22], oxides [23], metals [24] and nanoparticles, and
turns out to be interesting in various applications, but so far, no
study of the deposition of activated carbon has been reported by
this technique. Various micro-supercapacitors were designed with
this technique with interdigital ﬁngers ranging from 40 to 100 �m
width. The developments necessary for the inkjet deposition of the
active material are described in the ﬁrst part. Then, the electro-
chemical characterizations of the realized micro-supercapacitors
are presented and the results discussed. These devices display
excellent stabilities and electrochemical behaviors over a wide
potential window.

2.1. Process developments
Silicon dioxide (150 nm) was ﬁrst grown on silicon wafer by
plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) followed
by the evaporation of 150 Å of titanium and 300 nm of gold. The
electrodes patterns on which activated carbon had to be ﬁxed
were formed by photolithography and etching of the titanium/gold
layer.
A stable ink was then prepared by mixing an activated carbon
of high surface area (1700–1800 m2 g−1 for a 92 F g−1 electrode
capacitance, Kuraray Chemical Co.) with 5 wt.% polytetraﬂuo-
roethylene (PTFE) polymer binder in an ethylene glycol solvent.
The activated carbon composition was set to 3% weight rela-
tive to ethylene glycol. A Triton X100 (p-(1,3,3,-tetramethylbutyl)
phenoxy-poly(ethylene glycol)) surfactant was added to the solu-
tion in order to increase the wettability and the stability of the
emulsion [25].
This ink was then selectively projected onto the interdigital
gold ﬁngers. For this purpose, a hydrophobic surface function-
alisation of the silicon dioxide was performed by means of an
octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) treatment. The gold was therefore
more hydrophilic, i.e. with a higher surface energy, than the sur-
rounding hydrophobic silica surface, allowing thus the deposition
of the ink onto the gold electrodes acting as current collectors.
The substrate temperature was ﬁxed at 140 ◦C during the inkjet
deposition in order to have an instantaneous evaporation of the
droplets during impacts and get a homogeneous activated carbon
deposition located exclusively on the metal patterns. The elec-
trodes were ﬁnally annealed at a temperature of 240 ◦C.
2.2. Electrochemical characterizations
The two-electrodes EC micro-devices were characterized with
a 1 M Et4NBF4/anhydrous propylene carbonate electrolyte in a
glove box under Ar atmosphere with H2O and O2 levels less than
1 ppm (in order to prevent any early oxidation of the electrolyte),
using a Biologic VMP potentiostat. Electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out at open circuit
potential by applying a sinusoidal signal of 10 mV amplitude and
frequencies ranging from 100 kHz to 10 mHz.

and 40 �m of interspace (i). Gold micro-wires were then bonded
from the micro-device to the package for electrochemical charac-
terization (Fig. 2(b)).
A homogeneous deposition of activated carbon is observed
on the micro-supercapacitor, with a well deﬁned pattern and no
short circuit between the interdigital electrodes. The thickness of
the activated carbon deposit estimated from confocal microscopy
varies between 1 and 2 �m depending on the micro-device
sample.
3.2. Electrochemical characterizations
Fig. 3 shows the cyclic voltammogram (CV) performed on a
75 �m wide (w), 750 �m long (L) and 75 �m of interspace (i)
assembled micro-supercapacitor at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 in 1 M
Et4NBF4 propylene carbonate. The total surface of the conducting
electrodes is 2.295 mm2 (0.585 mm2 pad and 0.5625 mm2 ﬁngers).
It displays a symmetrical capacitive behavior with the typical rect-
angular shape as expected for double layer capacitive materials. The
weak redox wave observed at about 1.3 V could be attributed to the
redox reactions of electroactive surface functional groups present
on the carbon [26] or could be due to a variation of the capacitance
with the potential.
Fig. 4. Evolution of the capacitive current (total cell surface 2.295 mm2) deduced
from CV carried out at different scan rates.
To verify the capacitance provided by the microstructured car-
bon electrodes, an identical micro-device with bare gold electrodes
was tested in the same conditions (Fig. 3). We can clearly observe an
important increase of the current during the CV, directly related to
the capacitance and the energy of the carbon micro-supercapacitor.
Inkjet-printed micro-supercapacitors display moreover excel-
lent capacitive behaviors over a wide potential range of 2.5 V
in controlled atmosphere. This potential range allows the use of
micro-supercapacitors in various mobile electronic applications,
and could satisfy in this sense the growing need for integrated
energy storage solutions.
Fig. 4 clearly shows a linear dependency of the capacitive cur-
rent as a function of the scan rate. This current was calculated at
discharge reversal scan and it was averaged over the whole voltage
window. Since ion adsorption occurring upon charge processes in
supercapacitor electrodes involves surface phenomena this kind of
plot is typical for such electrochemical systems [27]. A small devi-
ation would imply an under diffusion control process as it is the
case, for example, at high rate for Faradaic reactions.
A mean cell capacitance of 0.4 mF cm−2 is deduced from the
slope of Fig. 4, and a maximal cell capacitance CT = 2.1 mF cm−2
is found at low scan rate (1 mV s−1), which is the highest value
reported for carbon EC micro-devices [19–21]. The estimated stack
capacitance lies between 1.6 and 2.7 F cm−3 and the maximal
energy density we can obtain for the micro-device for a 2.5 V poten-
tial range is 6.6 mJ cm−2.

3.3. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements
The
frequency
behavior
has
been
studied
by
EIS
at
a
bias voltage of 0 V. Fig. 5(a) shows the Nyquist plot of a
micro-supercapacitor, and Fig. 5(b) the evolution the speciﬁc
capacitance as a function of the frequency, calculated from
[28].
A micro-power of 44.9 mW cm−2 was estimated from the high
frequency part of the spectrum. When the frequency is decreased
from 100 Hz down to 10 mHz, the imaginary part of the impedance
increases corresponding to a capacitive behavior of the micro-
supercapacitor (Fig. 5(a)), associated with a leak resistance as can
be seen from the slope with an angle lower than 90◦ [29].
The impedance frequency behavior was also studied using the
frequency dependence of the complex capacitance (Fig. 5(b)). At
10 mHz, the speciﬁc capacitance is 1.0 mF cm−2, which is consis-
tent with the results obtained with CV (Fig. 4). The maximum
capacitance is nevertheless obtained for frequencies lower than
10 mHz, revealing a high relaxation time constant �0 of the micro-
device (and therefore a relative low power density), due probably
to the slight leakage current. Microstructured inkjet-printed EC
show therefore very promising electrochemical results. Future
work will be performed on the chemical formulation of the ini-
tial ink and heat post-treatments of the devices in order to have
micro-supercapacitors with higher electrochemical performances
and lower leakage current.
4. Conclusions
An integration process for micro-supercapacitors was presented
with a speciﬁc inkjet printing technology. Micro-supercapacitors
with interdigital ﬁngers as low as 40 �m width were obtained. Elec-
trochemical characterizations in 1 M Et4NBF4 propylene carbonate
reveal an excellent capacitive behavior of the micro-devices over
a 2.5 V potential range, for a cell capacitance of 2.1 mF cm−2. These
results are very promising and demonstrate the viability of such
technique for the elaboration of integrated micro-supercapacitors
on Si substrate.
Future developments will consist in depositing thicker active
material, optimizing the active material itself and providing a
full device encapsulation. This technology of carbon-based micro-
supercapacitors could address the need for micro-scale energy
storage.
