Nitrogen-containing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with open end and low speciﬁc surface area were prepared
via the carbonization of polyaniline (PANI) nanotubes synthesized by a rapidly mixed reaction. On the
basis of analyzing the morphologies and structures of the original and carbonized PANI nanotubes, the
electrochemical properties of PANI-based CNTs obtained at different temperatures as electrode materials
for supercapacitors using 30 wt.% aqueous solution of KOH as electrolyte were investigated by galvanos-
tatic charge/discharge and cyclic voltammetry. It was found that the carbonized PANI nanotubes at 700 ◦C
exhibit high speciﬁc capacitance of 163 F g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 and excellent rate capability
in KOH solution. Using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurement the nitrogen state and content
in PANI–CNTs were analysed, which could play important roles for the enhancement of electrochemical
performance. When the appropriate content of nitrogen is present, the presence of pyrrole or pyridone
and quaternary nitrogen is beneﬁcial for the improvement of electron mobility and the wettability of
electrode.

1. Introduction
Supercapacitor, which possesses high power density, high cycle
efﬁciency and a long cycle life, has attracted more and more atten-
tion owing to its wide range of potential applications, such as
hybrid power sources for electric vehicles, digital telecommuni-
cation systems and pulse laser technique [1]. According to the
mechanism of energy storage, supercapacitor can be divided into
two types: one is the electric double-layer capacitor (EDLC), which
stores energy through the separation of electronic and ionic charges
at the interface between electrode and an electrolyte solution.
The other is pseudocapacitor, which has Faradic reactions on the
electrode materials [2]. Three types of electrode materials have
been investigated for supercapacitor: carbon materials [1], metal
oxides, such as RuO2 and MnO2 [3] and conducting polymers, such
as polyaniline, polythiophene and polypyrrole [3]. Carbon materi-
als are the most important and applicable electrode materials for
commercial supercapacitor because of their stability in different
solutions, well processability and relatively low cost [4]. Other-
wise, it was found that nitrogen-rich carbon materials can also
be used as electrode materials for supercapacitors [5–11]. Lota et
al. prepared nitrogen-enriched porous carbons as electrodes by
pyrolyzing nitrogen-containing polymers and their blends with
coal-tar pitch, and pointed out that combining a high surface area

and a ration of the content of nitrogen seems to be a promising
way to improve the performance of supercapacitors [12]. They also
investigated the nanotube-based composites being rich in nitrogen,
and obtained the capacitances of 160, 120 and 55 F g−1 at 1 mHz,
1 and 10 Hz, respectively [6]. Kawaguchi et al. [13] reported a
nitrogen-containing carbonaceous material by pyrolysis of 2,3,6,7-
tetracyano-1,4,5,8-tetraazanaphthalene, and discussed the roles of
nitrogen for the improvement of speciﬁc capacitance. It is believed
that the presence of nitrogen changes the electron donor/acceptor
properties of graphene layers, thus affects the formation of electric
double-layers [14]. Simultaneously, the introduction of nitrogen
could produce a pseudo-capacitance besides the electric double-
layer capacitance, enhance the wettability in electrode-electrolyte
interface, and then improve the capacitance of electrode [13].
Since the ﬁrst report on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in 1991, CNTs
are of great interest due to their nanometer size, electrical con-
ductivity and mechanical performance [15]. Because of the unique
morphology, well-controlled nanostructure, surface functionality
and the cyclicity of the power supply, CNTs are regarded as suit-
able materials for electrodes in supercapacitors and lithium-ion
batteries [15–17]. The capacitances of carbon nanotube electrodes
for supercapacitors are generally in the range of 40–80 F g−1 [18].
Because the value depends upon nanotubes’ components, mor-
phologies, surfaces and pore structures, it can be enhanced by
surface modiﬁcation or attaching functional groups [4,18]. Modify-
ing these nanotubes by introducing heteroatoms, such as nitrogen,
is a known application in electrochemistry [5–7]. Jurewicz et al. [7]

activation and ammoxidation, and found that the capacitances of
modiﬁed nanotubes are less than 100 F g−1.
Polyaniline (PANI) ranks the most potentially useful conducting
polymers because of its facile synthesis, environmental stability,
and simple acid/base doping/dedoping chemistry [19]. PANI has
been considered as an important material for the application of
supercapacitor electrode [20–26]. The composite electrodes of car-
bon and PANI show a higher capacitance and a good rate capability.
Most signiﬁcantly, by controlling the synthesis conditions, PANIs
with various shapes, such as nanowires, nanoﬁbers, nanotubes and
hollow spheres, have been produced [27–31]. Correspondingly car-
bon nanostructures with special morphologies are easily prepared
from the PANI nanostructures by maintaining the original shapes
of PANIs through high-temperature heat treatment in an inert gas
atmosphere. Therefore we can get nitrogen-enriched carbon nano-
materials from PANI nanostructures. From this point of view, PANIs
with different morphologies can be considered as appropriate pre-
cursors for carbon nanomaterials containing nitrogen, which are
favourable for the electrochemical energy storage. The obvious way
to link both types of materials is the conversion of conducting poly-
mers into carbonaceous structures.
In this paper, we pay more emphasis on the preparation and
electrochemical properties of nitrogen-containing CNTs from PANI
nanotubes. As well known, a certain content of nitrogen in car-
bonaceous materials will enhance the capacitance of electrode
materials [10,12,14]. The pyrolysis of PANI at high temperatures
is a simple method to prepare nitrogen-enriched carbon materi-
als. Although some papers have introduced the carbonization and
structural conversion of polyaniline to carbon materials including
carbon nanotubes [32–37], there is no report on the carbonized
PANI nanomaterial as electrode for supercapacitor by now.
2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis of polyaniline nanotubes
PANI nanotubes have been prepared according to the previ-
ous literatures [19,38,39]. The typical process was performed as
follows: At ﬁrst, 3.423 g ammonium persulfate (Shantou Chem-
ical Factory, 98%) as the initiator and 1.09 ml aniline monomer
(Tianjin Chemical Reagent Factory, 99.5%) were dissolved in 60 ml
de-ionized water, respectively. Then the initiator solution was
poured into the monomer solution quickly with vigorous stirring,
and maintained in a quiescent state at room temperature for 24 h
to get the precipitate. The resulting precipitate was centrifugated,
washed and dried to obtain the desired PANI nanotubes.
2.2. Carbonization of polyaniline nanotubes
In the carbonization experiment, 1.0 g of PANI placed into an alu-
mina crucible was carbonized in a horizontal furnace under pure
nitrogen gas atmosphere according to the following heating proce-
dure. The sample was ﬁrstly heated to 400 ◦C with a heating rate of
1 ◦C min−1, and maintained for 2 h at this temperature, and then it
was increased to the ultimate temperatures of 600, 700, 850, 1000
and 1100 ◦C, respectively, with a heating rate of 0.5 ◦C min−1, and
keeping for 2 h at the ﬁnal temperatures. The heated samples were
weighed and named as PANI-600, PANI-700, PANI-850, PANI-1000,
and PANI-1100, respectively.
2.3. Characterization of PANI and carbonized polyaniline
nanotubes
The morphologies and structures of as-synthesized and car-
bonized materials were observed by scanning electron microscope
(SEM, Hitachi S-4700) and transmission electron microscope (TEM,
Hitachi H-800). The speciﬁc surface areas (SBET) were obtained by
Micromeritics ASAP 2020 Instrument from the adsorption data
in the relative pressure interval from 0.04 to 0.2 P Po−1 using
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. The elemental composi-
tion (C, H and N) was determined using an elemental analyzer (Flash
EA 1112). The chemical composition and state of samples were
measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) under a pres-
sure lower than 10−7 Pa with a Thermo ESCALAB 250 instrument.
XPS spectra were recorded using monochromatic Al K� (1486.6 eV)
X-ray sources with 30 eV pass energy in 0.5 eV step over an area
of 650 �m × 650 �m to the sample. Atomic concentrations were
calculated using peak areas of elemental lines after Shirley back-
ground subtraction, and taking the sensitivity factors into account,
the asymmetry parameters, as well as the measured analyzer trans-
mission function. The sample charging was corrected using the C 1s
peak (284.6 eV) as an internal standard. The quantitative analysis
was performed with XPSPEAK4 software.
2.4. Electrode assembly and measurement
The electrochemical performances of prepared samples were
measured with a three-electrode system that was described in
previous work of our group [20]. 80 wt.% of resulting samples,
10 wt.% of polytetraﬂuoroethylene (PTFE) and 10 wt.% of acetylene
black were mixed together to press into the graphite sheet as the
working electrode for supercapacitor. The counter and reference
electrodes were Platinum foil and Hg/HgO electrode, respectively.
The electrolyte was 30 wt.% KOH aqueous solution. The capacitance
properties were studied by galvanostatic charge/discharge and
cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests. The galavanostatic charge/discharge
was carried out by a Program Testing System (produced by China-
Land Com. Ltd., China) with the voltage range from 0.9 to 0.01 V.
The cyclic voltammetry was taken with a CHI660B electrochemical
working station. The sweep voltage ranged from −0.85 to 0.01 V in
cyclic voltam metric measurements.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Morphology and structure of polyaniline nanotubes and
carbonized PANI nanotubes
The morphologies of pristine PANI were observed by SEM and
TEM, and their images are shown in Fig. 1(a)–(d). As seen in Fig. 1,
the prepared PANI is nanotube in morphology with rough surface,
which is conﬁrmed by TEM observation. The length of PANI nan-
otubes is between 1 and 3 �m, and diameters range from 100 to
200 nm. PANI nanotubes cross each other, some inner paths are
joined together and each end of tubes is open. The wall thickness
of tubes is between 65 and 75 nm. The formation of PANI nan-
otubes has been analyzed in previous reports [31,39]. Brieﬂy, in
the primary stage, nano-sized oligomer crystallites were formed as
starting template for the nucleation of PANI nanotubes. The fur-
ther growth of nanotubes depended on the self-organization of
phenazine units.
In order to get nitrogen-containing carbon nanotubes, the pre-
pared PANI nanotubes were heated in N2 gas atmosphere at
different temperatures from 600 to 1100 ◦C. During the high-
temperature treatment, condensation and polymerization take
place with the escape of hydrogen and nitrogen atoms, remaining
the carbon skeleton. With increasing temperature, the non-carbon
atoms lost more, and the carbon skeleton would gradually shrink.
Fig. 2 displays the morphologies of the heated PANI at different
temperatures. As seen in Fig. 2, the shape generally maintains well
after heat treatment and some carbon nanotubes are destroyed and
broken into short tubes at higher temperature. The surface of the
carbonized PANI becomes smooth relatively. The TEM images effec-

tively conﬁrm the hollow tubular structure of the carbonized PANI.
We can observe each end of tubes is open. The PANI-700 CNTs show
the length of 1–2 �m and diameter of 150–170 nm, slightly smaller
than that of the pristine PANI nanotubes.
3.2. Chemical structure of PANI carbon nanotubes
Elemental analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
were used to measure the elemental composition of carbonized

samples. All the data are presented in Table 1. Survery XPS spectra
of carbonized samples at different temperatures are displayed in
Fig. 3. The mass loss of carbonization in Table 1 is calculated based
on the weight of previous and carbonized PANI. It can be found
that with the temperature increasing from 600 to 1100 ◦C, the mass
loss increases correspondingly. According to the data of elemental
analysis, we ﬁnd that there is a steady decrease in nitrogen and
hydrogen contents, and an increase in carbon as the temperature
increased, that is consistent with the previous report [32]. The dif-
ference between the data of elemental analysis and XPS is caused
by different test philosophy. However, the variation tendency of
elemental content is the same, i.e., with the temperature increas-
ing from 600 to 1100 ◦C, the content of carbon goes up. It can be
found that the content of oxygen is relatively low compared to that
of C and N with the temperature increasing from 600 to 850 ◦C. The
result of above is consistent with elemental analysis.
3.3. Electrochemical properties of PANI-based carbon nanotubes
To investigate the electrochemical performance of carbonized
PANI nanotubes as electrode material for supercapacitor, galavano-
static charge/discharge cycling measurement was performed in
KOH solution. The calculated speciﬁc capacitances that are stable
after 10 time cycles at every current density are summarized in
Fig. 4. Although the PANI-based carbon nanotubes possess low spe-
ciﬁc surface areas, PANI-700 and PANI-850 electrodes exhibit high
capacities of 163 and 110 F g−1, respectively, which are higher than
that of the pure PANI [20]. As a whole rule, the speciﬁc capacitances
decrease with the increase of carbonized temperature from 700 to
1100 ◦C, which could be related with the change of speciﬁc sur-
face areas (in Table 2) and the decrease of total polar functional
groups [40] as well as the elemental composition. PANI-600 is an
exceptional example. Although the speciﬁc capacitance of PANI-
600 is similar to that of PANI-850 at low current density, it fades
fast with the increase of current density, which could be ascribed to
the higher polar functional group content and the unstable carbon

skeleton formed at the low temperature carbonizaton. PANI-700
has the highest capacitance in these samples. At a current density of
1 A g−1 the speciﬁc capacitance of PANI-700 is as high as 133 F g−1,
which is about 82% of the speciﬁc capacitance at the current den-
sity of 0.1 A g−1, implying the high rate capability. Compared with
the common activated carbons [1,41], PANI carbon nanotubes pos-
sess lower speciﬁc surface areas, but higher capacities, which could
be related with the chemical state and the content of nitrogen in
carbonized PANI samples [10,11,13,14].
The stable charge-discharge cycling curve of carbonized PANI
at 700 ◦C is presented in Fig. 5. The curve is not a perfect tri-
angular shape, indicating a small pseudo-capacitance besides the
electric double layer capacitance, which would be caused by the
chemical state of nitrogen in PANI-700. Cyclic voltammetry mea-
surements were carried out within the potential range of −0.85 to
0.01 V to analyze the electrochemical behavior of supercapacitor.

Fig. 6 gives the cyclic voltammogram of PANI-700 electrode at dif-
ferent sweep rates. Although the voltammograms are not square
and the slopes are present, there is no obvious redox information
which is in accordance with the previous report [11], in which
the presence of pseudo-capacitance in electrode was conﬁrmed in
basic electrolyte, but the mechanism remains unclear. Kawaguchi
et al. [13] think that an asymmetrical rectangle of the CV curve is
due to the reversible pseudo-faradaic reaction. Hulicova et al. [42]
think that this slope is related to the pseudocapacitive properties
of carbonized samples, which should be ascribed to the presence of
incorporated nitrogen in samples. This statement is in accordance
with that deduced from the galvanostatic charge/discharege tests.
In addition, we can discover that the quicker the sweep rate is, the
bigger the responsive current is, which illustrates that the electrode
material has well reversibility.
3.4. Effects of nitrogen in PANI–CNTs on the electrochemical
performances
The chemical state of nitrogen in PANI carbon nanotubes is
investigated by XPS measurement. Table 2 shows the relative
quantities of surface nitrogen-containing groups and the speciﬁc
surface areas of samples. A typical XPS spectrum of N 1s displays
in Fig. 7. The chemical state of nitrogen atoms in carbonized sam-
ples could be assigned to ﬁve types according to previous reports
[9,11,12,43,44]. These ﬁve types are as following binding ener-
gies: 398.4 eV (pyridine-N-6), 400.5 eV (pyrrole or pyridone-N-5),
401 eV (quaternary-N–Q), 402.6 eV (pyridine-N-oxide or ammo-
nia), 405.5 eV (chemisorbed nitrogen oxides–N–Ox). As seen in
Table 2, the types of nitrogen in samples and the SBET are inﬂuenced
by the heat treatment temperature. As the temperature increasing
from 600 to 850 ◦C, the speciﬁc surface areas decrease from 253.6

to 21.3 m2 g−1. The chemical state of nitrogen is complex with dif-
ferent heat temperatures. There are total three types of nitrogen in
carbonized products: one at 398.4 eV is attributed to the pyridine
(N-6), which is at the edge of graphene layers in six-membered
rings [11]; the other one at 400.5 eV belongs to the pyrrole or
pyridone (N-5), which is in ﬁve-member rings or combined with
oxidized form [43]; the last one at about 401 eV is the quater-
nary (N–Q), the nitrogen atom of which is in a “valley” position
[45]. These types of nitrogen groups are presented in Scheme 1.
According to Table 2, we can see that all of the samples possess
7026

N-6. In addition, PANI-600 has N-5, and PANI-850, PANI-1000 and
PANI-1100 have N–Q. Only PANI-700 possesses all these types of
nitrogen. It was reported that N-6 species can be formed above the
temperature of 400 ◦C, and N-5 will be formed at higher tempera-
ture [11,45]. We surmise that with the temperature increasing from
600 to 1100 ◦C, the state of nitrogen in samples has changed from
N-5 to N–Q. At higher temperature, the chemical bond of N-5 is eas-
ily broken, and the new C–N or N–Q bond forms. The content and
state of nitrogen in samples will affect intensively the capacitive
performance.
The insertion of nitrogen atoms into graphene layers can change
values of EHOMO and ELUMO in order to reduce the band gap, thus
increase electron mobility and lower the electron work function
at the carbon/liquid interface in comparison to pure carbon [44].
There is a conclusion [46–48] that the capacitive behavior is dom-
inated by the electron mobility of the sample. The potential in the
double layer is shared between the solvent layer and the space-
charge layer, so the capacitance of the sample is provided by these
two aspects. Based on this view, increased mobility of electrons
in the sample would result in a larger space charge capacitance.
Among these samples N-5 and N–Q have electron donor tendency,
so their speciﬁc capacitances are higher than that of pure PANI.
However, PANI-1000 and PANI-1100 possessing low content of
nitrogen have relatively low speciﬁc capacitances, so we think the
appropriate content of nitrogen is a precondition for improving the
speciﬁc capacitance. PANI-600 and PANI-850 are enriched in N-5
and N–Q, respectively, however PANI-700 is enriched in both of
these structures. It is reasonable to believe that possessing both of
these structures can endow PANI-700 the highest speciﬁc capaci-
tance. In Scheme 1 we can ﬁnd obviously that N-5 and N–Q have a
great difference, in which the former occupies a “top” N position,
and the later is in a “valley” N position. According to the report [6],
the later one shows stronger donor electron character. Quaternary
nitrogen is the most appropriate position affecting the carbon elec-
tronic structure in order to lower an energy gap between lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital and the highest occupied molecular
orbital. So the speciﬁc capacitance of PANI-850 possessing qua-
ternary nitrogen is higher than that of PANI-600. Ultimately we
conclude that when the appropriate content of nitrogen is present,
being both N-5 and N–Q will enhance the capacitance with the fol-
lowing reasons: one is to improve the electron mobility, the other
is to enhance the wettability of the electrode to make electrolyte
more touch with active materials [13,14].
4. Conclusions
In summary, PANI with the tubular shape was synthesized
by a rapidly mixed reaction, and then nitrogen-containing CNTs
were prepared through high temperature treatment. The mor-
phologies, structures and electrochemical properties of PANI-based
CNTs were investigated. It was found that PANI can maintain the
original tubular morphology after heat treatment. The carbon nan-
otubes possess the diameter of about 100 nm and length of several
micrometers with open end and low speciﬁc surface area. When
PANI-based CNTs were used as the electrode materials for superca-
pacitors in KOH solution, they exhibit high speciﬁc capacity and
good cyclic stability, especially PANI-700 possesses the capaci-
tance of 163 F g−1 at the current density of 0.1 A g−1. The chemical
state and content of nitrogen in carbonized PANI nanotubes were
investigated by XPS. The reasons why carbonized PANI nanotubes
have higher speciﬁc capacitance would be ascribed to the pres-
ence of pyrrole or pyridone and quaternary nitrogen when the
appropriate content of nitrogen is present, which are beneﬁcial for
the improvements of electron mobility and the wettability of the
electrode.
