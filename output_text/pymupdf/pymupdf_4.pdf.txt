Supercapacitor electrodes and devices that utilise conducting polymers are envisaged to bridge the
gap between existing carbon-based supercapacitors and batteries to form units of intermediate speciﬁc
energy. This review looks at the major conducting polymer materials, namely, polyaniline, polypyrrole,
polythiophene and derivatives of polythiophene, as well as composites of these materials with carbon
nanotubes and inorganic battery materials. Various treatments of the conducting polymer materials to
improve their properties are considered and comparisons are made with other supercapacitor materials
such as carbon and with inorganic battery materials. Conducting polymers are pseudo-capacitive mate-
rials, which means that the bulk of the material undergoes a fast redox reaction to provide the capacitive
response and they exhibit superior speciﬁc energies to the carbon-based supercapacitors (double-layer
capacitors). In general conducting polymers are more conductive than the inorganic battery materials
and consequently have greater power capability. On the downside, conducting polymers swell and con-
tract substantially on charge and discharge, respectively. Consequently, cycle-life is poor compared with
carbon-based supercapacitors which generally only charge via adsorption and desorption of ions (giving
typically a few thousand cycles for conducting polymers compared with >500 000 cycles for carbon-based
devices).

market both in hybrid electric vehicles and pure electric vehicles to
improve regenerative braking (through fast charge capability) and
deliver larger acceleration (through fast discharge capability). Tra-
ditionally, capacitors have been constructed using a set of parallel
conducting plates separated by an insulator. Capacitive charge of
opposite sign builds up on the respective plates in response to a
voltage difference between them. The capacitances are delivered
in mF and �F quantities [1]. In more recent times, capacitors have
been developed that give hundreds to thousands of Farads and
these are usually known as supercapacitors, or ultracapacitors, and
were initially constructed from carbons of high surface area [2].
These are in fact two capacitors connected in series with a con-
ducting liquid media linking them. Such a supercapacitor device
derives its performance from a so-called double-layer capacitance
and is therefore often referred to as an (electric or) electrochemical
double-layer capacitor (EDLC). The capacitance in these devices is
stored as a build up of charge in the electrical double-layer in the
solution interface close to the surface of the carbon to balance the
charge in the carbon material.
Another type of supercapacitor, referred to as a pseudo-
capacitor, derives its capacitance from the storage of charge in the
bulk of a redox material in response to a redox reaction. This fast
redox reaction [3–5] acts like capacitance (hence the name pseudo-
capacitance). A pseudo-capacitor typically stores a greater amount
of capacitance per gram than an EDLC, as the bulk of the material
(not just the surface layer) reacts. On the other hand, an EDLC has
faster kinetics as only the surface of the carbon is being accessed.
An example of a pseudo-capacitive material is a conducting poly-
mer (CP) (the conductivity of which was ﬁrst reported in 1963 by
Weiss and co-workers in Australia [6–8] and ﬁrst utilised in super-
capacitors in the mid 1990s [4]) and it is this material that will
be the subject of this review. The review will focus on work done
post-2000 but for a comprehensive description of work pre-2000
readers should consult Ref. [9]. The concept of ‘bridging the gap’
with batteries to form conducting-polymer-based supercapacitors
with superior speciﬁc energy compared with carbon-based alter-
natives is illustrated in Fig. 1.
Conducting polymers are rendered conductive through a conju-
gated bond system along the polymer backbone. They are typically
formed either through chemical oxidation of the monomer (for
example with iron chloride) [5] or electrochemical oxidation of
the monomer. Two oxidation reactions occur simultaneously – the
oxidation of the monomer and the oxidation of the polymer [10]
with the coincident insertion of a dopant/counter ion (e.g. Cl−).
The dopant or doping level (in this p-type conducting polymer) is
typically below 1 dopant per polymer unit: approximately 0.3–0.5,
i.e., 2–3 monomer units per dopant. This is limited by how closely
the positive charges (so-called polarons) can be spaced along the
polymer chain. The polymers that are most commonly studied
for use in supercapacitor devices are polypyrrole, polyaniline, and
derivatives of polythiophene [11]. The typical dopant level for these
polymers, as well as their typical speciﬁc capacitances and voltage
ranges, are given in Table 1.
The difference between EDLCs and conducting-polymer-based
supercapacitors is shown schematically in Fig. 2. In general, carbon-

based supercapacitors have high power capabilities, due to the fast
sorption and desorption of ions, but a low speciﬁc energy [13].
Conducting polymers should improve the device as they undergo
a redox reaction to store charge in the bulk of the material and
thereby increase the energy stored and reduce self-discharge. One
signiﬁcant drawback of these materials is the relatively low power
(or lower rate of charge–discharge) due to the slow diffusion of ions
within the bulk of the electrode. Nevertheless, it is still proposed
that conducting polymers can bridge the gap between batteries
and double-layer supercapacitors as these electrodes have bet-
ter kinetics than nearly all inorganic battery electrode materials
(pseudo-capacitive materials) [13].
Conducting polymers are generally attractive as they have high
charge density and low cost (compared with the relatively expen-
sive metal oxides) [14,15]. It is possible to develop devices with
low equivalent series resistance (ESR), high power, and high energy
[16]. Polyaniline can exhibit a charge density of 140 mAh g−1,
which is slightly lower than that obtained with expensive metal
oxides such as LiCoO2 [17,18] but much higher than that given by
carbon devices that often deliver less than 15 mAh g−1 (perhaps
∼40 mAh g−1 for the individual electrode) [14]. Carbon–carbon
symmetric supercapacitor devices can achieve a speciﬁc power of
3–4 kW kg−1 and a speciﬁc energy of 3–5 Wh kg−1 when fully pack-
aged [13,19,20], while a conducting polymer supercapacitor, based
on polyaniline, can achieve a slightly lower power at 2 kW kg−1 but
double the speciﬁc energy (10 Wh kg−1) [19]. As will be discussed
in Section 3, the weight used for the calculation of speciﬁc energy

and power is often not speciﬁed. That is whether it is the weight of
device, packaged device, electrode or active material. This makes
comparison of different supercapacitor performances difﬁcult.
Double-layer capacitors are highly cycleable, namely, >0.5 mil-
lion cycles [2] whereas conducting polymer pseudo-capacitors
often begin to degrade under less than a thousand cycles
due to changes in their physical structure that are caused by
the doping/de-doping (intercalation/deintercalation) of ions [19].
Higher speciﬁc energies may be achieved with conducting poly-
mer electrodes by increasing the doping level. This comes at a cost,
due to a larger degree of counter ion insertion and de-insertion
with an accompanying volume change [21]. This volume change,
or swelling, causes mechanical failure of the electrode under pro-
longed cycling. Interestingly, results using conducting polymer
electrodes with electrolytes based on ionic liquids [22,23] show
that the electrodes perform better with greater life times, espe-
cially in actuators [24] where doping and undoping of ions into
the polymer is required for the shape changes. The preparation of
both conducting polymer electrodes and devices with ionic liquid
electrolytes will be discussed later in more detail.

Conducting polymers are attractive because they have good
intrinsic conductivity, namely, from a few S cm−1 to 500 S cm−1 in
the doped state [5,25] as can be seen in Table 2. Conducting poly-
mers have low band-gaps (1–3 eV) compared with conventional
polymers (10 eV) [5]. They have relatively fast charge–discharge
kinetics, suitable morphology, and fast doping and undoping pro-
cesses [29]. Conducting polymers also have plastic properties [25]
and are therefore easily manufactured, particularly as thin ﬁlms.
Conducting polymers can be p-doped with (counter) anions
when oxidised and n-doped with (counter) cations when reduced.
The simpliﬁed equations for these two charging processes are as
follows:
Cp → Cpn+(A−)n + ne−
(p-doping)
(1)
Cp + ne− → (C+)nCpn−
(n-doping)
(2)
The discharge reactions are, of course, the reverse of the above
equations. Complications can occur given that on oxidation a cer-
tain degree of cation inclusion (mixed doping) is possible under
certain circumstances. Examples of p- and n-dopable thiophene-
based conducting polymers are listed in Table 3, along with the
voltage ranges in which these processes occur.
Supercapacitor devices made solely from conducting polymers
can have three conﬁgurations [27,30–33]:
Type I (symmetric) using the same p-dopable polymer for both
electrodes.
Type II (asymmetric) using two different p-dopable polymers with
a different range of electroactivity.
Type III (symmetric) using the same polymer for both electrodes
with the p-doped form used as the positive electrode and the n-
doped form used as the negative electrode.
In addition, asymmetric (or hybrid) devices using a conducting
polymer positive electrode and carbon or lithium-based negative
electrode can be constructed [20,21,29,34].
A Type III device based entirely on conducting polymers is the
most attractive. Theoretically, it should be highly conductive in
the charged state as both electrodes will be doped (i.e. the nega-
tive is n-doped and the positive is p-doped) [14]. In addition the
charge is released at higher potentials (up to at least 3 V) com-
pared with Type I and Type II devices [14,21]. This higher potential
range should result in high speciﬁc energy and power due to the
1/2CV2 relationship [34]. In reality, these types of conducting poly-
mer supercapacitor devices do not perform as well as expected due
to the difﬁculty of the n-doping process.
Early studies of n-doped materials were performed on poly-
acetylene (Fig. 3a–b) and later poly-p-phenylene [14] (Fig. 3c).

(PThCNVEDT).
These polymers have high impedances upon n-doping and are
therefore not suitable for use as negative electrodes. Many con-
ducting polymers, such as polyaniline and polypyrrole, can only be
p-doped due to the very negative potentials required for n-doping,
when compared with the reduction potential limit of molecular
solvent-based electrolytes [35]. A puriﬁed electrolyte or a room-
temperature ionic liquid [36] with a wide electrochemical window,
particularly at negative potentials, is required for n-doping [4].
An example of a promising n-dopable material is polythiophene
and its derivatives. Polythiophene itself is not n-dopable in ace-
tonitrile [14] as the potential for n-doping is more negative than
the breakdown potential of the solvent at below −2.0 V vs. Ag|Ag+
[37,38]. Substitution at the 3-position with an aryl group results
in more positive n-doping potentials. These polymers are not very
conductive in the reduced state (at more negative potentials) and
have a low capacitance in this potential region. Consequently,
they are usually only employed as the positive electrode with a
negative electrode made from another material such as carbon
[21,29].
The properties of conducting polymers can be greatly enhanced
by forming composites between the conducting polymer and other
materials such as carbon (including carbon nanotubes) [39], inor-
ganic oxides and hydroxides [40,41], and other metal compounds
[42–44]. Examples of some of these composites and their electro-
chemical properties are given in Table 4. These electrodes can allow
the device to be made symmetric (Type I or Type III) with the same
positive and negative electrode. The composite materials have
improved conductivity (particularly at the more negative/reducing
potentials) and better cycleability, mechanical stability, speciﬁc
capacitance and processability [5].

This review will focus on the main conducting polymers used
for supercapacitor devices, namely, polyaniline, polypyrrole and
derivatives of polythiophene, together with the use of composites
to improve the properties of these conducting polymer materials.
Finally, a comparison with other types of supercapacitor materials
will be made.
2. Discussion
The three main methods used for determining the capaci-
tance of conducting polymer materials are illustrated in Fig. 4,
namely, constant-current charge–discharge, cyclic voltammetry
(CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Ideally,
the charge–discharge curve for a capacitor should be linear with
a slope equal to the current divided by the capacitance. Calculation
of capacitance from this data is given in Fig. 4a. In the absence of
redox processes, the cyclic voltammogram of a capacitor should be
rectangular with the capacitance roughly equal to half the value
of the difference in plateau currents divided by the scan rate, see
Fig. 4b. Finally, the low-frequency components of EIS data repre-
sent the capacitive region and a plot such as Fig. 4c can be used
to determine the capacitance. There are, however, other ways of
extracting capacitance from EIS measurements, e.g., modelling the
data with equivalent circuits.
2.1. Polyaniline
Polyaniline has been studied extensively as a supercapacitor
or battery electrode material [11,15,19,27,42,44,49,50,53,55–68].
The structure of polyaniline is illustrated in Fig. 3d. Polyaniline has
many desirable properties for use in a supercapacitor device; it has
high electroactivity, a high doping level (0.5 – see Table 1), excel-
lent stability and a high speciﬁc capacitance (400–500 F g−1 in an
acidic medium) [19]. In addition, it has good environmental sta-
bility, controllable electrical conductivity (around 0.1 S cm−1 in the
doped state with a Li dopant, but can range from around 0.1 to
5 S cm−1 as shown in Table 2), and can be easily processed [15,27].
A major disadvantage of polyaniline is that it requires a proton to
be properly charged and discharged; therefore a protic solvent, an
acidic solution or a protic ionic liquid is required [58].
Polyaniline has been reported to have a wide capacity range
from 44 to 270 mAh g−1 [11]. This variation in capacity is related to
many factors, including synthetic route used, polymer morphology,
the amount and type of binders and additives, and the thickness of
the electrode. Polyaniline has the most variable speciﬁc capacitance
of all conducting polymers; the speciﬁc capacitance achievable is
higher for electrodeposited than for chemically formed polyaniline.
It has been reported [27] that the cycle-life of polyaniline for a
Li-doped positive electrode was over 5000 cycles, during which the
speciﬁc capacitance dropped from 100 to 70 F g−1. In another study
[15], polyaniline doped with LiPF6 achieved a speciﬁc capacitance
of 107 F g−1 that decreased to 84 F g−1 after 9000 cycles.
A device has been constructed with polyaniline as the positive
electrode and carbon as the negative [21], i.e., a so-called hybrid
electrochemical capacitor. According to Park and Park [21] their
device gives similar or higher values than recently reported Type III
supercapacitors made from polythiophene derivatives. A constant-
current charge–discharge (0.5 mA cm−2) test yields 380 F g−1, a
speciﬁc energy of 18 Wh kg−1 and a speciﬁc power of 1.25 kW kg−1
(at 20 mA cm−2). Using cyclic voltammetry, a cycle-life of 4000
cycles was observed. The device charges between 1.25 and 1.5 V
and discharges between 1.4 and 1.0 V.
Polyaniline can be modiﬁed to make it more stable by forming
poly(n-methyl aniline) (Fig. 3e) [11]. In this polymer, the proton
exchange sites are blocked by the methyl groups, so that the poly-
mer is stabilised against chemical degradation and made more
redox active. A combination of this conducting polymer with a
lithium negative electrode can achieve a capacity of 52 mAh g−1.
2.2. Polypyrrole
Polypyrrole offers a greater degree of ﬂexibility in elec-
trochemical
processing
than
most
conducting
polymers
[69],
and
consequently
the
material
has
been
the
subject
of much research as a supercapacitor or battery electrode
[3,12,31,45–47,51,52,55,70–85]. On the downside, polypyrrole
(Fig. 3f) cannot be n-doped like the thiophene derivatives, and thus
it has only found use as a cathode material.
Due its greater density, polypyrrole has a high capacitance per
unit volume (400–500 F cm−3) [86]. One disadvantageous aspect of
the dense growth is that it leads to limited access to the interior sites
of the polymer for dopant ions. This reduces the capacitance per
gram, especially for thicker coatings on electrodes [87]. Polypyr-
role is typically doped with single-charged anions such as Cl−,

ClO4− and SO3− but if doped with multiple-charged anions, e.g.
SO42−, physical crosslinking of the polymer occurs [10]. Accord-
ing to Suematsu et al. [10], the cross-linked materials have high
diffusivity and higher capacitance, presumably due to the greater
porosity of the growth. Suematsu et al. [10] do not back up this
statement by quoting the speciﬁc capacitance of the material;
only capacitance per unit volume of material is quoted and is
lower (100–200 F cm−3) than typically denser polypyrrole layers
(400–500 F cm−3), as expected.
Combining polypyrrole with polyimide (a dopant of high molec-
ular weight) is claimed to improve the charge storage properties
[81], due to the polyimide matrix protecting the polypyrrole from
oxidative degradation and the polyimide is cathodically electroac-
tive (whereas polypyrrole is anodically electroactive). Polyimide
has excellent thermal stability and very good mechanical proper-
ties. No details as to how the material performed as a supercapacitor
electrode were given, except for EIS data that was used to exam-
ine the capacitive behaviour. Polyimide is generally considered an
insulative material which may result in poor performance.
Polypyrrole has been used as an electrode to make a Type
I supercapacitor, as well as combined with poly(3-methyl thio-
phene) or PMeT to form a Type II version [31]. The Type I device has
a discharge capacitance of 8–15 mF cm−2, which is similar to that
for the Type II device. The voltage range is around 0.5–1.0 V for the
Type I device, but is extended to 1.2 V for the Type II. Polypyrrole has
also been used to fabricate an all solid-state-supercapacitor with a
PVA-based polymer electrolyte [88]. The design gave up to 84 F g−1
[88] with a stable capacitance after 1000 cycles, and delivered a
speciﬁc energy of 12 Wh kg−1.
2.3. Thiophene-based conducting polymers
A range of n-dopable thiophene (Fig. 3g) based conducting poly-
mers is given in Table 3. The mass speciﬁc capacitance in the
n-doped form is, in general, lower than that of the p-doped form. It
is also found, in general, that the conductivity in the n-doped form
is poor. This limits the use of these materials in the n-doped form as
an anode material. Most polythiophene derivatives are stable in air
and moisture in both the p-doped and undoped forms [5]. Accord-
ing to Ryu et al. [29] and Villers et al. [30], Type III devices made
from polythiophene derivatives should achieve 30–40 Wh kg−1 and
5–10 kW kg−1 per active material mass. An example of this type of
symmetric supercapacitor is made from poly(ditheno(3,4-b:3′,4′d)
thiophene) (PDTT) [89,90]; a p-doped PDTT electrode had a capac-
itance of 106.4 mF cm−2 while a n-doped PDTT electrode exhibited
a capacitance of 43.2 mF cm−2 [89].
Polythiophene is n-doped at very low potentials (below −2.0 V
vs. Ag|Ag+) [37,38] and has low stability to oxygen and water, as
well as lower conductivity, than in the p-doped state [20]. As a
consequence, it has high self-discharge (i.e., it is easily oxidised
back to the neutral form) and has low cycle-life in devices. To
overcome these disadvantages, polythiophene derivatives with a
lower band-gap (i.e., derivatives that are n-doped at less nega-
tive potentials) can be prepared [29,30,91]. By substituting at the
3-position of the thiophene ring with phenyl, ethyl and alkoxy
groups stability to oxygen and water can be further improved
[90]. A further approach is to add electron withdrawing groups
to these substituents. The general structure of these substituted
thiophene derivatives is presented in Fig. 3h. Some of these deriva-
tives are poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) (Fig. 3i),
poly(3-(4-ﬂuorophenyl)thiophene) (PFPT) (Fig. 3j), poly(3-(3,4-
diﬂuorophenyl)thiophene) (MPFT), and poly(1-cyano-2-(2-(3,4-
ethylenedioxylthienyl))-1-(2-thienyl)vinylene) (ThCNVEDT) [30].
There are few reports of n-doped thiophene derivatives being used
as supercapacitor materials because of intrinsic difﬁculties in the
n-doping process [89], which result in a strong dependence of the
behaviour on the size of the counter ion and on the solvent.
A successful strategy to overcome the problem of the n-doped
polymer is to use carbon as the negative electrode in an asymmetric
conﬁguration, with the p-doped polymer as the positive electrode.
This results in a device with superior speciﬁc power (compared
with carbon–carbon supercapacitors) and that can be cycled at least
10 000 times [20].
The potential range and speciﬁc capacitance of some polythio-
phene derivatives are in Tables 3 and 5. A popular thiophene
derivative is poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and its
structure is given in Fig. 3i. The polymer is highly conductive (see
Table 2), as are many of the thiophene derivatives, and can be p-
doped and n-doped. The polymer has a higher potential range of
1.4 V, but the smallest speciﬁc capacitance due to a combination
of the large molecular weight of the monomer unit and the low
doping level [12].

tron rich and consequently has a low oxidation potential [104]
together with a wide potential window over which the capacitance
is high (1.2–1.5 V wide) [30,87,99] (also see Tables 1 and 3). The
polymer has a low band-gap of 1–3 eV, is highly conducting in
the p-doped state (300–500 S cm−1) [5], has good thermal and
chemical stability and high charge mobility that results in fast
electrochemical kinetics [5,29,99,107]. The main reason why
PEDOT has very fast kinetics is its high surface area [99] coupled
with high conductivity. The polymer has also been found to have
good ﬁlm-forming properties [107] and can be switched rapidly
with a minimum of side reactions leading to a long cycle-life [104].
On the negative side, because of its large molecular weight and
a doping level of around 0.33 [5], it has a relatively low speciﬁc
capacitance of around 90 F g−1 [12]. Lota et al. [5] claim a capaci-
tance of 180 F g−1 is possible with PEDOT, but the authors reported
this value for a thin ﬁlm that is impractical for energy-storage
purposes. When the authors prepared a pellet (10–20 mg), the
PEDOT gave a capacitance of 80–100 F g−1, as expected. Another
disadvantage of this polymer is that the monomer cannot be
dissolved in aqueous solvents. Consequently, a volatile and toxic
organic solvent, such as acetonitrile, is generally used to deposit
the polymer.
PEDOT has been used in both symmetric supercapacitors (Type
I device) and a hybrid device with a PEDOT cathode and an acti-
vated carbon anode [29]. After 1000 cycles (between 0 and 1 V),
the symmetric supercapacitor has a capacity of 22 F g−1 in Et4NBF4
in propylene carbonate (PC) and 27 F g−1 in LiPF6 in ethylene
carbonate/dimethyl carbonate (EC/DMC), while the asymmetric
supercapacitor, after 1000 cycles, has a capacity of 19 F g−1 in PC
and 50 F g−1 in EC/DMC [29].
Many polythiophene derivatives have lower capacitances in the
n-doped state relative to the p-doped state, as can be seen in
Table 3. It has been found that poly(3-(4-triﬂuoromethylphenyl)-
thiophene) (PTFMPT) has the same charge for n- and p-doping
[14] but exhibits ‘charge trapping’ where cycling of the mate-
rial results in the formation of electronically isolated regions in
the material. Consequently, less charge is released on discharge
than on charge. Laforgue et al. [108] constructed a conducting
polymer/carbon/binder electrode and observed charge trapping in
initial cycles, but this decreased with continued cycling [108]. The
best results were found using poly(3-(4-ﬂuorophenyl)thiophene)
(PFPT), where the n- to p-doping ratio is 60%. When using polythio-
phene as the conducting polymer, the speciﬁc capacitance of the
electrode is 260 F g−1, but with PFPT only 110 F g−1 was achieved.
For PFPT, cyclic voltammetry for over 500 cycles resulted in lit-
tle loss in capacity. In other work on PFPT by Rudge et al. [14], it
was found that n-doping was more facile at a higher electrolyte
concentration with smaller ions, but the ability to n-dope was hin-
dered when using highly solvated alkali metal salts in acetonitrile.
Rudge et al. [14] suggested tetramethyl ammonium salts, in par-
ticular Me4NCF3SO3, as the best results were achieved with this
electrolyte.
PFPT has been made into a hybrid supercapacitor with an acti-
vated carbon negative electrode [109]. For 4 cm2 cells, a speciﬁc
energy was 48 Wh kg−1 and the speciﬁc power was 9 kW kg−1,
while for 60 cm2 prototypes the speciﬁc energy was 7.5 Wh kg−1
and the speciﬁc power was 250 W kg−1. Industrial production of
conducting polymer devices is difﬁcult and therefore it was sug-
gested that the use of composite electrodes would be advantageous
[109].
Substituting other molecular groups on the polythiophene, to
improve n-doping, results in higher molecular weight (hence lower
speciﬁc capacitance), higher materials cost and the requirement
for higher injected charge and greater mechanical strength. Poly(3-
methyl thiophene) (PMeT) is a popular thiophene derivative that
is employed in supercapacitor electrodes [79,110,111]. PMeT has
a low cost, moderately low molecular weight (and consequently
a reasonable speciﬁc capacitance of 220 F g−1), and a low resistiv-
ity (2 � cm2) [20,111]. The charge is delivered at high potentials
in a Type III device [14] and it can be cycled several thousand
times without signiﬁcant loss in capacity [112]. Laforgue et al. [20],
prepared a hybrid device using PMeT with a cell ESR of approx-
imately 12 � cm2, most of which was attributed to the carbon
electrode as the measured ESR of the positive electrode was less
than 1 � cm2. In the hybrid conﬁguration, the speciﬁc capacitance
is around 220 F g−1 for the PMeT electrode and 35 F g−1 for the ﬁnal
device. In another device made from PFPT the speciﬁc capacitance
was 210 F g−1 and 29 F g−1 for the electrode and the ﬁnal device
respectively. The derivatised polythiophene electrodes are highly
cycleable with 0.02% capacity loss in 2000 cycles in the case of PFPT
and 0.004% loss in 10 000 cycles for PMeT [20].
Using PMeT, a hybrid device with a carbon negative have been
constructed [111,112]. Arbizzani et al. [111] prepared a hybrid
device and achieved a speciﬁc capacitance (per gram of active mate-
rial) of 39 F g−1 and a capacity of 19 mAh g−1 at a discharge current
of 5 mA cm−2. This dropped to 28 F g−1 and 8 mAh g−1 at a sub-
stantially larger discharge current of 40 mA cm−2. At 5 mA cm−2,
the speciﬁc energy is 30 Wh kg−1 and the average speciﬁc power
is 0.50 kW kg−1, whereas at 20 mA cm−2, the speciﬁc energy is
19 Wh kg−1 and the average speciﬁc power is 1.8 kW kg−1.
Poly(cyclopenta(2,1-b;3,4-b′-dithiophen-4-one))
(PcDT)
is
another interesting thiophene-based material (see Fig. 3k) which
can be used in either the p- or n-doped state [113]. The doping
level, as determined from cyclic voltammetry, was 0.19 dopants
per monomer unit, signiﬁcantly lower than polythiophene. The p-
and n-doping states give 70 F g−1 and the energy and power per
mass of active material are around 6 Wh kg−1 and 1 kW kg−1 (at
18 s discharge), respectively. This device has a higher cell voltage
of 2–3 V compared with polyaniline and polypyrrole (1 V), but
the n-doped form is very unstable. After 20 cycles, the capacity
decreases from 35 to 10 mC cm−2 but remains constant for the
next 80 cycles.
Other devices have been made using polythiophene deriva-
tives and their speciﬁc energy and power has been calculated (per
active material). Villers et al. [30] achieved for 1-cyano-2-(2-(3,4-
ethylenedioxylthienyl))-1-(2-thienyl)vinylene (PThCNVEDT, see
Fig. 3l) a maximum speciﬁc energy and power of 40 Wh kg−1 and
10 kW kg−1. Ferraris et al. [96] quote values of 45 Wh kg−1 and
8
G.A. Snook et al. / Journal of Power Sources 196 (2011) 1–12
11 kW kg−1 for a poly-3-(4-cyanophenyl) thiophene (2.9 V) elec-
trochemical capacitor in acetonitrile. Laforgue et al. [109] obtain
values of 48 Wh kg−1 and 9 kW kg−1 for a carbon/P-PFPT hybrid
capacitor in propylene carbonate. When constructing a prototype,
Laforgue et al. [109] achieved device performance of 7 Wh kg−1 and
250 W kg−1.
When using carbon as the negative electrode [30] there was a
linear charge–discharge curve when the carbon was the limiting
electrode whereas there was a more battery-like curve when the
carbon was in excess that suggested redox-type behaviour in
the conducting polymer. Using the thiophene derivatives 3-(4-
ﬂuorophenyl)thiophene (PFPT), 3-(3,4-diﬂuorophenyl)thiophene
(P-MPFPT), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and 1-
cyano-2-(2-(3,4-ethylenedioxylthienyl))-1-(2-thienyl)vinylene
(PThCNVEDT) typically 50–70% of the capacitance remained after
1000 cycles [30].
2.4. Room-temperature ionic liquid electrolytes
In general, ionic liquids have desirable electrolyte properties
as they usually have high ionic conductivity, low vapour pressure,
non-ﬂammability, a wide electrochemical window, and high ther-
mal stability [114,115]. A number of electrodes and devices have
been prepared using these electrolytes with conducting polymers.
Balducci et al. [110] prepared a hybrid supercapacitor device based
on an activated carbon negative with a PMeT positive electrode and
an ionic liquid as the electrolyte, namely, N-butyl-N-methyl pyrro-
lidinium bis-(triﬂuoromethanesulfonyl)imide. This ionic liquid was
chosen as it has a low melting temperature, and is hydrophobic and
highly cycleable with a wide voltage window that allows hybrid
supercapacitor operation between 3.43 and 1.5 V. The device exhib-
ited a speciﬁc energy of 14 Wh kg−1 and power of 1.9 kW kg−1.
This supercapacitor was cycled 16 000 times. After 1000 cycles,
the coloumbic efﬁciency was 99.3%, the capacitance was 15 F g−1
and the capacity was 6 mAh g−1. After 16 000 cycles, the average
power was 90% of the initial value and the energy was 40–50% of
the original value. The ESR with a large separation of electrodes
of 0.5 mm was 17 � cm2. Other recent work [116] has utilised
PEDOT with the ionic liquid: 1-ethyl 3-methyl imidizolium bis-
triﬂuoromethylsulfonyl imide as the electrolyte which is more ﬂuid
than the electrolyte used by Balducci et al. [110]. For an electrode
with 19 mF cm−2 capacitance, the ESR was approximately 5 � cm2.
In the past, the deposition of the homo-polymers from ionic
liquids has proven difﬁcult and the resultant layers exhibit poor
kinetics for both the charge and discharge reactions that are mainly
due to dense growth. Snook and Best [117] combined two poly-
mers (PPy and PEDOT) as one layer using electrodeposition from
a mixed monomer solution in an ionic liquid, namely, 1-butyl-
methylpyrrolidinium bis(triﬂuoromethanesulfonyl)imide (C4mpyr
TFSI). This creates a superior polymer layer with improved mor-
phology and higher ionic transport, while maintaining a similar
speciﬁc capacitance to the homo-polymer PPy. Less dense growth
seems to occur due to the mismatch of growth between the two
conducting polymers.
2.5. Thiophene/imidizolium
In work carried out by Naudin et al. [118], a thiophene monomer
was covalently attached to an imidizolium counter ion. This is part
of a class of conducting polymers which are self-doped where the
counter ion is covalently attached. The polymer is p- and n-dopable
at potentials centred at 0.65 V vs. Ag|Ag+ (p-doping) and −2.0 V vs.
Ag|Ag+ (n-doping). Charge compensation for both oxidation and
reduction is achieved via the anion. Thus, the presence of a perma-
nent positive charge on the polymer backbone may be useful for the
development of supercapacitors where the charge compensation is
solely by anions in the supporting electrolyte.
2.6. Redox conducting polymers
Typical conducting polymers have discharge capacities that
are not much higher than 100 mAh g−1. Performance can be
increased by functionalising the polymer with electroactive moi-
eties. Poly(1,5-diaminoanthraquinone) (pDAAQ) with the redox
active anthraquinone moiety is an example of a redox conducting
polymer [35,119]. Another example is poly(2-2′-dithiodianiline)
(pDTDA) [119]. This polymer has a high conductivity (0.3–2 S cm−1
from −2.0 to 0.8 V) [35], a speciﬁc capacity of 238 mAh g−1, a wide
potential window of approximately 2.3 V, fast redox kinetics, a high
electrical conductivity, and the two redox reactions occur at the
same potential. A symmetrical device was made from the poly-
mer and achieved 25–46 Wh kg−1 and 10.2–30.5 kW kg−1 per active
mass at discharge rates of 30–90 C. The speciﬁc power, however,
seems high (it is quoted per active mass) and is unlikely to be
translated to a device performance (as quoted per device mass).
2.7. Composites
A list of general composites and treatments of the conduct-
ing polymers and the speciﬁc capacitances achievable is given in
Table 4. With the exception of mixing with ruthenium oxide, which
is extremely costly, the speciﬁc capacitances are generally below
500 F g−1. Combining polypyrrole with iron oxide to achieve a spe-
ciﬁc capacitance of around 400 F g−1 is very promising [41]. This
cheap metal oxide could produce a supercapacitor electrode of high
speciﬁc energy.
It appears that the main advantage of compositing is not
improved speciﬁc energy but, in fact, the improved stability of
the materials (improved cycleability) and superior conductivity.
Strategies for improving cycle-life that are often limited by the
swelling and consequent breakage of the polymers, include com-
positing with carbon nanotubes to allow room for swelling as well
as irradiation [49–51] or sonication [54] during production of the
conducting polymer. Composite electrodes of polymers with other
materials have been investigated mainly to extend cycle-life and
improve conductivity, but many other beneﬁts are seen to arise as
outlined in the examples below.
2.7.1. PEDOT/PSS
When doped with a polyanion such as polystyrenesulfonate
(PSS), PEDOT has good compatibility with polar group polymers
and allows good device performance when using aqueous elec-
trolytes. In order to achieve high speciﬁc power in a supercapacitor
device, the fast kinetics of the electrochemical process are required.
In organic media, the PEDOT/PSS material does not swell and this
indicates a high ionic resistance and a slow electrochemical pro-
cess [107]. Blending this composite material (PEDOT/PSS) with
polyethyleneoxide (PEO), which is an ionic conductor, improves
the ionic conductivity of PEDOT. The PEO phase swells in ace-
tonitrile to allow easier ion motion. Using 50% PEDOT–PSS/PEO, a
speciﬁc power of 100 W kg−1 is achieved and appears to be a very
small. Regardless, the authors claimed that the PEDOT–PSS formed
a highly porous structure that results in very fast and efﬁcient
electrochemical reaction. Nonetheless, the power values measured
here do not support this assertion.
In other work, the combination of PEDOT with the PSS dopant
[120,121], provided low ionic resistance, but the kinetics were
limited by a high electronic resistance. Ghosh and Inganas [120]
claimed that when the electrode was put in pure water it swelled
extensively and underwent cracking. High interfacial resistance
arises [122] due to a low compatibility between the electrolyte
G.A. Snook et al. / Journal of Power Sources 196 (2011) 1–12
9
and polymer. The charge-transfer resistance was reduced [120,122]
by crosslinking the conducting polymer with Mg2+ ions. Because
electronic conductivity was now the limiting case, the pores are
ﬁlled by electrodepositing polypyrrole [120,122]. This structure or
morphology results in much better mechanical and electrical prop-
erties. In these studies [122], going from low power (100 W kg−1)
to high power (3 kW kg−1) the pure polypyrrole speciﬁc energy
reduces by one-ﬁfth. On the other hand, for the PEDOT–PSS/PPY
composite there is no loss in energy over this power range.
2.7.2. Composites with carbon nanotubes
Polypyrrole
can
be
combined
with
CNTs
[4,39,69,79,85,123–126]
to
form
a
composite
for
the
posi-
tive electrode. Zhou et al. [123] used pyrrole combined with
treated functionalised single-walled CNTs and claimed 350 F g−1,
4.8 kW kg−1 and 3.3 kJ kg−1 for this positive electrode. A speciﬁc
energy of 3.3 kJ kg−1 translates to a speciﬁc energy of 0.92 Wh kg−1.
This value appears to be low compared to the speciﬁc capacitance
achieved. It also appears that the speciﬁc capacitance may have
been reported on the basis of conducting polymer weight and
not composite weight. CNTs are electron acceptors and PPy is
an electron donor so the two form a charge-transfer complex.
One of the electrodes gave a capacitance of 205 F g−1 at 0.4 A g−1
and 50 F g−1 at 2.5 A g−1. This drop in capacity is due to the inac-
cessibility of the composite electrode material. Even though the
composite structure is more open than PPy itself, it must not be
sufﬁciently open to allow such high currents to be passed through
the structure. The best electrode prepared by these authors gave a
performance of 350 F g−1 at 0.4 A g−1 and 200 F g−1 at 30 A g−1.
Polypyrrole can be co-deposited with carbon nanotubes by
oxidising the monomer in the presence of negatively charged mul-
tiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNT) [69]. In the absence of any
other dopant, the polymer will be doped by these nanotubes [69].
The carbon nanotubes are made by treatment in an aqueous acid
solution to form charged groups such as carboxylate, hydroxide
and nitrous groups on the surface of the carbon. A monomer
concentration of 0.5 M is used with a range of nanotube concen-
trations, namely, 0.025–0.4 wt% MWNTs. As the concentration of
the MWNTs increases, the thickness of the polymer coating on
the MWNT decreases. When combining with 0.4 wt% MWNTs, the
polymer layer gave a mass speciﬁc capacitance of 190 F g−1 with
an electrode speciﬁc capacitance of 2.1 F cm−2 [69]. The mass spe-
ciﬁc capacitance is slightly lower than that for pure PPy, however,
the electrode speciﬁc capacitance is quite high as generally PPy is
limited to about 0.7 F cm−2. This is due to a more open or porous
structure resulting from the MWNT backbone.
Chen et al. [124], found that polypyrrole on its own exhibited a
plateau in capacitance with increasing ﬁlm thickness (at 10 C cm−2)
and thereby indicated limited access to the interior redox sites.
Combining PPy with carbon nanotubes resulted in a linear capac-
itance versus deposition charge up to the same ﬁlm thickness
(10 C cm−2). This suggests that the nanotubes open the structure
and limit the thickness of the deposited PPy and thus allow the
majority of internal sites to be accessed by ions.
Combining polythiophene with carbon nanotubes as a compos-
ite [5] results in improved cycleability and stability. This is due
to the fact that the entangled mesoporous network of nanotubes,
which supports the polymer structure, allows the material to adapt
to volume changes, so that the open network structure does not
need to expand and contract as much. The volume change, which
can cause great stresses, is often the cause of poor cycleability.
Combining PEDOT with carbon means that there is no need for
polymeric binders and that conductivity in the undoped state is
improved [5,101]. The PEDOT, like most conducting polymers, is
poorly conducting in the reduced state, so by combining with highly
conductive carbon, the conductivity at these reducing potentials is
increased. Using carbon nanotubes can increase the cycle-life as
the composite can adapt to volume changes upon insertion and
removal of counter-ions [5]. In a study by Lota et al. [5], com-
posite electrodes were prepared by three different methods: (i)
direct polymerisation on ultrasonically dispersed CNTs (130 F g−1),
(ii) mixing of polymer with carbon nanotubes (composite capaci-
tance of 120 F g−1), and (iii) electrochemical deposition of polymer
onto the CNTs (up to 150 F g−1). In separate work [101], a fourth
method was used where a negatively charged CNT suspension and
the polymer were co-deposited [87] as in previous work by Chen
et al. [69,85,124]. Successful co-deposition occurred with capaci-
tances of at least 0.5 F cm−2 achieved. A symmetric supercapacitor
[5] with electrodes made of 75 wt% PEDOT/25 wt% CNT degraded
by only 5 F g−1 (from 85 F g−1) in 3000 cycles, but the device had
a limited operating potential of 0.8 V. An asymmetric device using
80 wt% PEDOT/20 wt% acetylene black as the positive electrode and
activated carbon as the negative gave an extremely good cycle-life
with little loss in capacitance after 20 000 cycles (160 F g−1) [5].
2.7.3. Other composites
A porous structure of a carbonised polyacrylonitrile (PAN) aero-
gel support was coated with a thin ﬁlm of polyaniline to give
a foam like and highly reticulated composite structure [19]. The
polyaniline is deposited in a thick coating so that the PAN aerogel
capacitance contribution is no longer dominant. The electrochem-
ical behaviour is now dominated by the polyaniline; however, the
foam like carbon structure will provide a conductive backbone
to provide high power. For a voltage range of 0.6 V, an energy of
4.25 Wh kg−1 and a power of 1.2 kW kg−1 (13 s discharge) were
achieved. Over a wider cycling voltage range of 0.8 V, an energy
of 5.8 Wh kg−1 and power of 1.5 kW kg−1 were possible [19].
Deposition of RuOx on PEDOT, either by dip hydrolysis or
electrochemical deposition, resulted in an electrode with a capac-
itance of 435 F g−1 [99]. The highest reported value for RuOx is
720–768 F g−1 [99]. In the same study, a symmetric PEDOT unit
[99] was able to deliver 12.4 mAh g−1, whereas a symmetric version
using the composite with the ruthenium oxide gave 27.5 mAh g−1
with a voltage of 1.0 V. Huang et al. [40] have claimed an impres-
sive 1409 F g−1 for a composite with ruthenium oxide with PEDOT.
While this device shows promise, the ruthenium starting materials
are too expensive to produce commercially viable supercapacitors.
Polyaniline has been combined with a polyoxometallates to
improve the stability, charge propagation and energy-storage capa-
bility [42]. An electrochemical co-deposition was found to be the
most successful. This supercapacitor could be cycled for at least
2000 cycles while retaining around 115 F g−1 but only being cycled
over a voltage range of 0–0.5 V. Polyoxometallates have also been
combined with conducting polymers in other work [42–44] but are
more likely to ﬁnd application based on the photoelectrochemical
ability of polyoxometallate structures.
2.8. Prototypes
To date, prototypes with only small geometric areas have been
made with conducting polymers and, in general, propylene carbon-
ate rather than acetonitrile has been used as the host solvent for the
electrolyte [33]. Hybrid supercapacitor modules/stacks have been
made by Laforgue et al. [20] with PMeT as the positive electrode
and activated carbon as the negative, and delivered 3 V and more
than 1.5 kF capacitance and 2–3 kW of power. Such devices used
carbon-coated aluminium current collectors and had a resistance
of 33 m�. From capacitance and ESR data it was calculated that the
device gave 5 Wh kg−1 and 2 kW kg−1. The authors estimated with
mass optimisation that a device with an energy of 13 Wh kg−1 and
power of 5 kW kg−1 could be achievable.

Du Pasquier et al. [13] have constructed an asymmetric device
with a lithium titanate (Li4Ti5O12 or LTO) anode and a PFPT cathode.
LTO has excellent stability and rate capability as it is a zero-strain
material [127]. Supercapacitor devices based on LTO/C have the
following performance, 20 Wh kg−1, 90% utilisation, the ability to
be charged at 10 C charge rates, and a cycle-life of the order of
1000 cycles. On the downside, this system suffers from high self-
discharge. The positive electrode (PFPT) delivers 270 F g−1 and a
capacity of 40–45 mAh g−1, while the negative electrode (LTO)
achieves a capacity of around 160 mAh g−1. Constructing a device
with both these positive and negative electrodes and using 7 plates,
a speciﬁc energy of 12 Wh kg−1 can be achieved based on device
weight. This device can be charged at the 10 C rate and discharged
at the 100 C rate. In one of these devices, 14% of the capacitance
was lost after 1500 cycles.
Wang et al. [73] proposed a new anode for a ﬂexible energy-
storage device made entirely of conducting polymer electrodes
(i.e., both the cathode and the anode). The cathode was polypyr-
role and the anode was styryl-substituted dialkoxyterthiophene
(poly(OC(10)DASTT)) on a Ni/Cu-coated nonwoven polyester. The
discharge efﬁciency was measured at 94% and the capacity was
39.1 mAh g−1.
2.9. Comparison with other types of supercapacitor materials
A comparison of the speciﬁc capacitances of conducting poly-
mer and conducting polymer composites with other supercapacitor
materials is given in Fig. 5. It is obvious that both conduct-
ing polymer and metal oxide materials (generally referred to as
pseudo-capacitors) increase the amount of speciﬁc capacitance
available for a device when compared with carbon-based superca-
pacitor materials, but this is generally at the sacriﬁce of cycle-life.
The other notable point, at the opposite end of the scale, is that
ruthenium oxide is capable of giving speciﬁc capacitances that
are far superior to those of all other materials. In reality, how-
ever, ruthenium oxide is far too expensive to be a practical option
for supercapacitors. Polyaniline is the most promising material
when considering the speciﬁc capacitance of conducting polymers
materials. The speciﬁc capacitance can, however, vary signiﬁcantly
depending on the method of production of the polymer. Moreover,
utilisation of polyaniline as a supercapacitor material is com-
plicated by the requirement for sufﬁcient proton activity in the
electrolyte solution to give satisfactory cycling. A variety of val-
ues for manganese oxide are given in Fig. 5 and this is because
capacitance is dependent on the phase, morphology and form of
the oxide that vary according to the method of synthesis. Nev-
ertheless, this material appears to be the greatest competitor to
conducting polymers as a supercapacitor material. Speciﬁc capaci-
tances comparable to that of polyaniline are possible with the other
conducting polymer materials by making a composite with, for
example, PEDOT and iron oxide. The advantages of such a composite
is that the speciﬁc capacitance is high and the ﬂexible nature of the
ﬁlm assists the production of devices. Other conducting polymer
composites (for example with carbon materials) often do not result
in greater speciﬁc capacitances, but have many other advantages
such as increased cycle-lives and charge rates.
3. Conclusions
Conducting polymers offer many advantages as supercapacitor
electrodes. They are ﬂexible, highly conductive, easily processable
and can be made into ﬁlms. Many conducting polymers exhibit
high speciﬁc capacities and capacitances, while being able to deliver
energy at a relatively rapid rate. The major disadvantage of the con-
ducting polymers when used as supercapacitor electrode is poor
cycle-life. In general, symmetric supercapacitors based on con-
ducting polymers will have a lower cycle-life than those based on
carbon. This is unavoidable, because as anions or cations are doped
or undoped into the conducting polymer, there is a correspond-
ing volume change of the electrode when compared with carbon
supercapacitors which involve only simple ion sorption and des-
orption. The literature tends to give vague reports of cycle-life of
conducting polymer devices. Authors claim ‘little’ loss in capac-
itance over thousands of cycles but the depth of these cycles is
usually not quoted. The main strategies for improving cycle-life
include irradiation or sonication during production, or composit-
ing the conducting polymer with carbon nanotubes to increase
volume, improve porosity and allow room for swelling of the con-
ducting polymer. A more recent method for increasing porosity
and inﬂuencing the morphology of the conducting polymer elec-
trode materials has involved co-deposition of different conducting
polymers in an ionic liquid. It is anticipated that this should also
increase cycle-life due to a greater degree of freedom to accommo-
date swelling of the electrode and a smaller amount of continuous
thick conducting polymer material.
A degree of caution with over interpreting speciﬁc capacitance,
energy and power data in the literature has to be applied. This is
due to the fact that many numbers quoted are not device values and
quite often relate only to the active material and do not include the
mass of the binders, conductive carbon ﬁllers, electrolyte and pack-
aging. Again, this makes comparison of numbers in the literature
often difﬁcult.
Many investigations focus on mass speciﬁc properties and quote
values per mass of active material. Often, however, the more impor-
tant parameter is the area speciﬁc values for the devices. In other
words, often (electrode) area speciﬁc capacitance (F cm−2) can be
just as important as mass speciﬁc capacitance (F g−1). This means
that the amount of capacitance for a given electrode geometric area
will give an idea as to the device capacitance that is possible. In this
respect, PEDOT is superior to many other conducting polymers due
to its high porosity and deep accessibility of ions to the interior sites
of the polymer layer. This means that while having a low mass spe-
ciﬁc capacitance (typically 90–100 F g−1) it can still produce a large
electrode speciﬁc capacitance (well in excess of 5 F cm−2), which
will translate to a large absolute device capacitance.
It should be noted, that the chemical method of deposition is
limited in terms of how much polymer can be produced as a ﬁlm.
Consequently, this method is most often only suitable for thin
ﬁlms. If the capacitance of these thin ﬁlms is converted to capac-
itance per area of electrode the value is lower when compared

11
to carbon-based supercapacitors. On the other hand, the use of
electrochemical deposition methods yields thicker deposits of the
conducting polymer that lead to broader peaks in the cyclic voltam-
mograms and thereby suggesting slower kinetics. Consequently,
only small geometrical area prototypes of supercapacitors have
been made with conducting polymers and new strategies need to
be devised to make both electrodes and devices with high speciﬁc
capacitances. It is proposed that room-temperature ionic liquids
(RTILs) will play an important part in harnessing the power of con-
ducting polymers in supercapacitor devices. Furthermore, RTILs
will most likely increase the cycle-life of the conducting polymer
materials in supercapacitor devices.
Conducting polymers are most promising for supercapacitors
with asymmetric conﬁgurations, i.e., with a conducting-polymer-
based positive electrode and a carbon-based negative electrode.
These devices appear to have much greater cycle-life as the con-
ducting polymer electrode experiences a smaller voltage swing.
Also, a range of composites, in particular with carbon-based mate-
rials, are promising in terms of improving the characteristics
of the positive electrode. When comparing such materials with
metal oxides, they can achieve comparable speciﬁc capacitance
at an appreciably lower cost and with the added beneﬁt of supe-
rior mechanical properties and often also superior conductive
properties. For these reasons, conducting polymers are promising
supercapacitor materials.
