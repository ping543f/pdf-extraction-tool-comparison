Introduction
A new class of ordered mesostructured carbon materials with
high micropore content received considerable attention in the
last decade due to their outstanding adsorption properties in
combination with high chemical stability and good biocom-
patibility [1]. These materials have developed as valuable
adsorbents, catalyst host materials, and for biological appli-
cations [2].
The
ﬁrst
synthesis
of
ordered
mesoporous
carbons
(CMK-1) was reported by Ryoo et al. in 1999 [3]. CMK-1 was
obtained by nanocasting an organic precursor (sucrose) into
an
ordered
mesoporous
silica
exo-template
(MCM-48),
followed by subsequent carbonization and matrix removal.
In comprehensive studies different silica templates (e.g.
SBA-15) and carbon precursors were also investigated [4,5].
In comparison with metal organic frameworks and activated
carbons, carbon replica structures offer rather low micropore
volume [6]. In contrast, advanced microporous structures
such as CDC materials with large speciﬁc surface areas and
micropore volumes can be prepared by chlorination of differ-
ent carbide materials [7–11]. The porosity is generated by
selective etching using chlorine at elevated temperatures.
The pore size of carbide-derived carbons can be controlled
by process parameters predominantly producing micropo-
rous carbons. CDCs have been proposed for energy storage
applications in gas storage and as electrodes in supercapaci-
tors [12–15]. However, the chlorination of mainly ceramic
carbide
powders
preferentially
resulting
microporous
carbide-derived carbons structures with random pore orien-
tation [7,8]. In recent studies our group introduced a new syn-
thesis strategy for the preparation of mesostructured carbide-
derived carbons by a two-stage synthesis strategy [16]. In the
ﬁrst step ordered mesoporous silicon carbide was obtained by
nanocasting polycarbosilane [17,18]. The resulting hexagonal
ordered replica ceramics were then chlorinated at different

conditions resulting in ordered mesoporous carbide-derived
carbons (OM-CDC). Hexagonal OM-CDC materials (DUT-18,
Dresden University of Technology) have a hierarchical pore
system with high micro- and mesoporosity, resulting in
extraordinarily high methane storage capacity and good mass
transport [19].
Nevertheless, in hexagonal systems, mass transport is
unidirectional, whereas cubic mesoporous systems (e.g. KIT-
6: Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology) are
known to have better mass transport properties due to the
higher degree of pore interconnectivity [20].

Experimental
2.1.
KIT-6 [20]
33.3 g Pluronic (EO20PO70EO20 P123, Aldrich) was dissolved in
1204 g deionized water and 65.8 g of conc. HCl (37%) and stir-
red over night at 308 K in a closed 250 ml one neck ﬂask. To
this solution ﬁrst 33.3 g of n-butanol (Sigma Aldrich >99.4%)
and afterwards 16 g of TEOS (Sigma Aldrich 98%) were quickly
added and stirred for 24 h at 308 K. The milky suspension was
transferred to an autoclave and annealed at 353 K for 24 h.
The solid product was ﬁltered, washed intensively with an
ethanol/water-mixture and calcined at 823 K according to
the literature introduced parameters.
2.2.
Cubic ordered mesoporous silicon carbide by wet
inﬁltration SiC-1, 2 [18]
In a typical synthesis procedure, 2 g of the above synthesized
KIT-6 was inﬁltrated with 1.95 g of polycarbosilane precursor
solution (PCS-800, Mw = 800 from Aldrich) in 28.2 mL of
n-heptane and 1.4 mLof n-butanol.The amount of PCS-800 pre-
cursor was calculated, with respect to its density of 1.1 g/cm3
by speciﬁc total pore volume of applied KIT-6 (0.89 cm3/g).
The mixture was then left overnight for evaporation in a hood
in an opened beaker, under constant stirring. Obtained pow-
der material was placed in an alumina boat and in a tubular
furnace under constant argon ﬂow (40 mL min�1) and heat
treatment was conducted according to the following temper-
ature program RT-573 K with 150 K h�1, then 5 h at 573 K, fol-
lowed by heating to 973 K with 30 K h�1. After reaching the
973 K the sample was heated to desired pyrolysis temperature
(SiC-1: 1073 K or SiC-2: 1273 K) with 120 K h�1 and maintained
for 2 h. Afterwards, composite samples were dissolved in a
mixture of EtOH/H2O/40% HF (each one 40 mL), shaken and
left for 1 h of silica etching. Then the solution was ﬁltered
over a ﬁlter paper and washed with large amounts of EtOH
(200 mL). The SiC materials were left drying overnight in a
hood (on the ﬁlter paper) and collected the next day.
2.3.
Cubic ordered mesoporous silicon carbide by incipient
wetness inﬁltration SiC-3
1.42 g of SMP-10 (Starﬁre Systems) and mass of DVB: 1.42 g of
SMP-10 and 0.36 g of p-divinylbenzene (80% Sigma Aldrich)
were drop-wise added to 2 g of above described KIT-6, and
intensively mixed. Afterwards, the obtained mixture was
evacuated over night at room temperature to obtain a homo-
geneous, quantitative pore ﬁlling. The pre-ceramic composite
system was then pyrolyzed according to above described
pyrolysis conditions at 1073 K.
2.4.
Mesostructured
carbide-derived
carbons
CDC-1–3
[16,19]
Mesostructured carbide-derived carbons were prepared via
chlorination of ordered mesoporous silicon carbide materials
(SiC-1–3) at 1273 K. In a typical procedure, 1 g of SiC-1–3
material was heated in a quartz boat inside a quartz tube (in-
ner tube diameter 25 mm) in a horizontal tubular furnace in
30 mL min�1 argon ﬂow to the desired temperature (450 K h�1).
Subsequently, Cl2 was introduced for 3 h (30 mL min�1 ﬂow)
while the argon ﬂow was maintained at the same level. After
that time Cl2 was switched off and the product was cooled
down to room temperature in argon ﬂow. Residual chlorine
was removed by post reductive treatment in hydrogen ﬂow.
In a typical procedure 200 mg of OM-CDC was heated in a
quartz boat inside quartz tube in horizontal tubular furnace
in 30 mL min�1 H2 ﬂow to 873 K for 2 h (300 K h�1).
2.5.
Characterization
Prior to all adsorption measurements, the samples were de-
gassed for 16 h at 473 K using the evacuation equipment of
the adsorption devices. Nitrogen and hydrogen physisorption
isotherms were measured at 77 K using a Quantachrome
Autosorb 1C apparatus. Prior to the measurement, the sam-
ples were degassed in vacuum at 423 K for 24 h. Speciﬁc sur-
face areas were calculated using the BET equation (p/
p0 = 0.05–0.2).
The
pore
size
distribution
was
estimated
according to the non-local density functional theory (NLDFT)
equilibrium model for slit/cylindrical pores for CDC samples
using the Autosorb 1.56 software from Quantachrome. The
speciﬁc micropore volume was also calculated by above men-
tioned DFT model. Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) exper-
iments were performed on a Bruker Nanostar (sealed tube, Cu
Ka; 1.5406 A˚ ) with a position sensitive HiStar detector. Sam-
ples for TEM analysis were prepared by dipping carbon coated
copper grids into an ethanol suspension of CDC materials.
TEM investigations were performed on a 200 kV-TEM FEI Tec-
nai T20 instrument. High pressure hydrogen adsorption mea-
surements were performed at 77 K up to 135 bar on about 0.2 g
sample. A high pressure volumetric BELSORP-HP apparatus
was used to quantify the Gibbs excess amount of hydrogen
adsorbed. The total volume of the empty vessel was deter-
mined via helium measurement at 298 and 77 K. Assuming
that helium does not adsorb at 298 K, the sample volume
and so called helium density of the sample are determined
via helium measurement. A magnetic suspension balance
(Rubotherm) was used to measure the difference in mass of
samples deposited in a stainless steel sample holder, sus-
pended within a high pressure vessel after pressure change.
After the buoyancy correction of the experimental results re-
lated to the displacement of gas by the sample and sample
holder (container), the adsorbed amount was calculated as
described earlier [19,21]. FESEM (Field Emission Scanning
Electron Microscopy) measurements were carried out with a
3988
C A R B O N 4 8 ( 2 0 1 0 ) 3 9 8 7 –3 9 9 2
Stereoscan 260 SEM and TEM (Transmission Electron Micros-
copy) investigations were performed on a 200 kV-TEM FEI Tec-
nai T20 instrument.
Adsorption measurements of n-butane were performed
with a micro-balance (B111, Setaram) in combination with a
micro-calorimeter (TG-DSC 111, Setaram) at 298 K and atmo-
spheric pressure under dynamic conditions (nitrogen and
n-butane ﬂow). All samples were degassed at 423 K over night
in nitrogen ﬂow. High purity gases were used for the adsorp-
tion measurements (N2: 99.999% (Air liquide), n-butane:
99.95% (Air liquide)).
A Netzsch STA-409 instrument was used for thermal anal-
yses. The materials were heated in a corundum crucible up to
1273 K with 10 K min�1 in air atmosphere.
Micro-Raman spectroscopy was performed using an Ar ion
laser excitation (488 nm) on a Ramascope 1000 Raman micro-
spectrometer (Renishaw, UK) equipped with a charged cou-
pled device (CCD) detector and an optical microscope for
focusing the incident laser beam to a 1–2 lm spot size. The
spectra were collected in the extended regime in the range
of 800–1800 cm�1. Prior to analysis, the microspectrometer
was calibrated using a plain Si wafer.
For the electrochemical characterization the EDLC were
assembled in a symmetrical two-electrode conﬁguration.
The electrode preparation and EDLC assembly was described
by us in detail previously [22]. We selected 1 M tetraethylam-
monium tetraﬂuoroborate salt (electrochemical grade, Alfa
Aesar) solution in acetonitrile (99.9%, extra dry, Acros Organ-
ics, Geel, Belgium). Prior to electrolyte preparation, TEABF4
salt was dried for 2 h at 423 K in a vacuum oven located inside
the glovebox. The beaker-type EDLC device was placed in a
custom designed airtight glass cell equipped with two Swage-
lok electrical feedthroughs and taken out of the glovebox for
electrochemical characterization.
The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests
were carried out using a Zahner IM6 electrochemical worksta-
tion (Zahner-Elektrik GmbH and CoKG, Kronach, Germany) in
the frequency range of 10 mHz–100 kHz with a 10 mV AC
amplitude. The charge–discharge (C–D) tests were carried
out using an Arbin SCTS supercapacitor testing system (Arbin
Instruments, TN, US) between 100 and 15,000 mA/g, based on
the mass of a single electrode.

Results and discussion
In this communication the synthesis of cubic OM-CDC
materials (designated as DUT-19) is reported for the ﬁrst time.
Polycarbosilane
(PCS-800)
dissolved
in
n-heptane
was
inﬁltrated by wet inﬁltration into the pores of cubic ordered
KIT-6 and pyrolyzed at 1073 and 1273 K. Replica carbons,
received by HF treatment and chlorination at 1273 K for
3 h
are
abbreviated
as
CDC-1
and
CDC-2,
respectively
(Table 1). Additionally, functionalized polycarbosilane SMP-
10 in combination with p-divinylbenzene as the cross-linking
agent (m(SMP-10)/m(DVB): 80/20) was studied as a precursor
system (CDC-3).
According to N2-physisorption measurements, presented
in Fig. 1A and ESI 2, type IV isotherms characteristic for mes-
oporous materials are observed for all intermediates. How-
ever,
speciﬁc
surface
area
and
the
micropore
volume
increases signiﬁcantly during the chlorination process from
1014 m2/g
and
0.17 cm3/g
(SiC-3)
up
to
2914 m2/g
and
0.58 cm3/g (CDC-3), respectively summarized in Table 1 and
ESI 1. The latter is attributed to selective silicon removal. Low-
er pyrolysis temperature resulted in a larger micropore vol-
ume and speciﬁc surface area, whereas pyrolysis at 1273 K
(CDC-1) favours larger total volume and pore sizes. Addition-
ally, CDC replica structures obtained from SMP-10-DVB pre-
cursor system have signiﬁcantly higher total pore volumes
compared to PCS-800 derived CDC structures in spite of sim-
ilar micropore volumes.
The pore size distribution and mean pore diameter of the
SiC and CDC replica structures are strongly dependant on
the pyrolysis and chlorination conditions, respectively. For in-
stance, increasing pyrolysis temperature from 1073 to 1273 K
leads to the formation of SiC ceramics with larger mesopore
diameter (ESI 2B). In comparison to the studies of Yeon
et al. on the chlorination of precursor derived SiCN ceramics
these different mesopore sizes and distributions are main-
tained during the chlorination process at similar (CDC-1) or
higher temperatures (CDC-2, Fig. 1A) [23]. The latter demon-
strates the effect of applied silica KIT-6 as an exo-template
inducing mesostructuring of silicon carbide and carbide-de-
rived carbons.
Small angle powder diffraction patterns of the replica
ceramics conﬁrmed their well ordered, mesoporous silicon
carbide structures (ESI 3) with lattice constants of 18.3 nm
(SiC-1, 2) and 19.9 nm (SiC-3). However, after chlorination only
CDC-3 shows the characteristic 210 peak in the low angle area
(Fig. 1B).
These results differ signiﬁcantly from PCS-800 derived
hexagonal ordered CDC prepared in SBA-15 and suggest a
strong dependence of the carbon replica structure on the
symmetry of the silica exo-template [16,19].

The ordered mesoscopic structure of CDC-3 could be a re-
sult of the better pore ﬁlling of the twisted KIT-6 pore arrange-
ment by the lower molecular weight SMP-10 compared to the
PCS-800 precursor.
Additionally, hydrosilylation reactions of allyl group con-
taining SMP-10 in combination with p-divinylbenzene agent
initiate low temperature cross-linking [18,24]. The smaller lat-
tice constants of CDC-3 carbon (16.6 nm) and SiC ceramics
(SiC-1/2: 18.3 nm, SiC-3: 19.9 nm) as compared to the KIT-6
(21.4 nm) structure can be explained by sintering processes
during the pyrolysis and chlorination, respectively [19].
The mesoscopic ordering of CDC-3 can also be conﬁrmed
by
transmission
electron
measurements
presented
in
Fig. 1C. FESEM patterns show similar particle sizes and sur-
face morphologies of KIT-6 exo-template, ceramic SiC inter-
mediates and CDC replica structures (ESI 4). The latter
results demonstrate good structure conversation during the
pyrolysis and chlorination process.
Hydrogen physisorption measurements of CDC replica
materials at 77 K show a large H2-uptake of up to 29.9 mg/g
at ambient pressure (Table 1). In order to evaluate the perfor-
mance of mesostructured carbide-derived carbons the high
pressure H2 storage capacity of ordered CDC-3 replica mate-
rial was measured. The corresponding excess isotherm is pre-
sented in ESI 5 with a remarkable maximum Gibbs excess
amount of 52.5 mg/g at 40 bar.
Additionally, one of the highest reported values for CH4
uptake of 0.22 g/g at 100 bar was obtained for CDC-3 at
298 K (Fig. 2A) [14,25,26]. In relation to our previous investiga-
tions on OM-CDCs, the introduced cubic replica structure has
approximately 50% and 6% higher methane uptake as com-
pared to microporous and hexagonally ordered CDC materi-
als, respectively [19].
These results were also conﬁrmed by dynamic n-butane
physisorption measurements at ambient pressure (Fig. 2B)
since the maximum uptake of 0.87 g/g (CDC-3) at 80 vol.% is
higher than the referenced systems with 0.48 g/g (CDC-micro)
and 0.76 g/g (DUT-18). Similar adsorption kinetics of cubic and
hexagonally ordered carbon replica structures were achieved
at low n-butane concentrations of 2 vol.%.
The latter results demonstrate a strong dependence of the
CDC adsorption performance on the pore structure. The main
reason for the varying hydrogen and hydrocarbon storage
capacities of microporous and mesoporous carbide-derived
carbons is affected by the different mesopore volumes since
the investigated samples show similar micropore volumes
[19]. In addition to pore volume effects, pore symmetry affects
the storage capacity. The cubic CDC-3 replica has a 14% high-
er n-butane uptake as compared to the hexagonal carbon
structure although total pore volume is only slightly higher
(4%).
The CDC materials show good thermal stability under oxi-
dative conditions up to 723 K and quantitative carbon com-
bustion above (ESI 6).
Recently, we reported the results of the electrochemical
characterization
of
hexagonal
ordered
mesoporous
CDC
materials (DUT-18) [22]. Since these materials have shown
outstanding performance as electrode materials in electro-

chemical double layer capacitors (EDLC), our interest was the
investigation of the energy storage properties of mesoporous
CDCs with cubic ordered mesopore structure.
CDC-3 was characterized in a symmetrical two-electrode
assembly using tetraethylammonium tetraﬂuoroborate in
acetonitrile (1 M) as the electrolyte. A high speciﬁc capaci-
tance of 100 F/g was determined from galvanostatic charge–
discharge measurements (Fig. 3A). In comparison to the
capacitance of the DUT-18 materials ranging from 125–
170 F/g it is signiﬁcantly lower [22].
Due to the much higher speciﬁc surface area of CDC-3 with
2914 m2/g in comparison to DUT-18 materials with 2400 m2/g
one would expect a speciﬁc capacitance of similar magnitude.
One explanation could be the higher chlorination tempera-
ture of 1273 K for CDC-3. It has been shown that the ratio of
integrated intensities of the D-band (disordered carbon) and
G-band (ordered graphitic carbon) (ID/IG) from the Raman
spectra decreases with increasing temperature [22]. A higher
ratio of disordered carbon leads to a higher speciﬁc capaci-
tance [11].
The ID/IG ratio of CDC-3 (Raman spectra, see ESI 7) of 1.92 is
slightly below the ratio of hex-CDC (2.02) produced at 1173 K
explaining the lower capacitance.
A promising resistance to capacitance fading could be ob-
served over a wide current density range of 0.1–20 A/g
(Fig. 3A). The mesoscale transport pores are responsible for
the excellent frequency response of the capacitance as shown
by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements
of CDC-3 in comparison to the commercially available micro-
porous activated carbon YP-17D (Fig. 3B).

Conclusion
Cubic ordered mesostructured carbide-derived carbons were
synthesized by nanocasting and subsequent chlorination
method using a KIT-6 exo-template. Resulting CDC materials
offer excellent hydrocarbon storage capacitance and good
performance
as
electrode
material
for
supercapacitor
applications.
