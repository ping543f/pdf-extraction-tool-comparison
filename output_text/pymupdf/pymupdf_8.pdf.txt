The electrodes mass ratio of MnO2/activated carbon supercapacitors has been varied in order to monitor
its inﬂuence on the potential window of both electrodes and consequently to optimize the operating
voltage. It appeared that the theoretical mass ratio (R = 2), calculated considering an equivalent charge
passed across both electrodes, is underestimated. It was demonstrated that R values of 2.5–3 are better
adapted for this system; the extreme potential reached for each electrode is close to the stability limits
of the electrolyte and active material, allowing a maximum voltage to be reached. During galvanostatic
cycling up to 2 V, the best performance was obtained with R = 2.5. The speciﬁc capacitance increased
from 100 to 113 F g−1 during the ﬁrst 2000 cycles, then decayed up to 6000 cycles and ﬁnally stabilized
at 100 F g−1. SEM images of the manganese based electrode after various numbers of thousands cycles
exhibited dramatic morphological modiﬁcations. The later are suspected to be due to Mn(IV) oxidation
and dissolution at high potential values. Hence, the evolution of speciﬁc capacitance during cycling of
the asymmetric capacitor is ascribed to structural changes at the positive electrode.

1. Introduction
Electrochemical capacitors are of great interest for energy man-
agement, being able to deliver a very high power in a short time.
However, for broadening the spectrum of their applications, the
energy density (E):
E = 1
2CU2,
(1)
(C: capacitance and U: cell voltage) has to be improved [1,2]. The
cell voltage depends on the stability window of the electrolyte; the
highest values are obtained with non-aqueous electrolytes, reach-
ing 2.7 V in industrial systems [3]. However, such media are quite
expensive, ecologically unfriendly and require cell construction in
air-free atmosphere. For aqueous electrolytes, the theoretical sta-
bility window is 1.23 V and is practically around 1 V for symmetric
capacitors with carbon electrodes[4]. Although the capacitance val-
ues are higher and the equivalent series resistance (ESR) is lower
in such electrolyte in comparison to the organic medium, the cell
voltage is too low and should be improved in view of potential
applications.

a promising way to increase voltage in aqueous electrolyte. For
the negative electrode, the material of choice is activated carbon
(AC) [5,6] because of its low cost, good polarizability, high speciﬁc
surface area and pore diameter adaptable to the size of ions.
Moreover, the presence of heteroatoms (N, O, or P) allows the
speciﬁc capacitance to be enhanced owing to pseudofaradic charge
transfer reactions [1,5,7–11]. In the case of the positive electrode,
battery-like metal oxide (operating at constant potential during
charging and discharging) is the ﬁrst electrode material which
has been investigated. A voltage of 1.6 V is reached with AC as
negative electrode and a battery-like material as positive electrode
in alkaline medium; however, this system displays a short cycle
life and a low power density [12,13]. Another possibility is to use
a Li–intercalation positive electrode with a lithiated electrolyte
[14–16]. Even if the capacitance and operating voltage (1.4–1.8 V)
seem quite interesting, these supercapacitors exhibit a poor cycle
life. Conducting polymers have been also used as positive electrode
in acidic medium [17]. An asymmetric polyaniline/activated carbon
cell exhibits a high speciﬁc capacitance (more than 300 F g−1) but
a small voltage, whereas the PEDOT/activated carbon system can
operate up to 1.8 V with a lower speciﬁc capacitance of 120 F g−1
[17]. Nevertheless, the use of conducting polymers as positive
electrode is limited by the low stability of the materials [18].

trode and a modiﬁed activated carbon negative electrode (modiﬁed
by anthraquinone grafting for enhancing the pseudo-capacitive
character) [20] in acidic medium, the cell voltage reaches 1.3 V and
the speciﬁc capacitance 95 F g−1. Beside the moderate performance
of this system, the high cost of ruthenium oxide precludes further
developments. Therefore, cheap transition metal oxides such as
manganese oxide [21–25], iron oxide [26] and vanadium oxide
[27] have been extensively investigated as positive electrode
in supercapacitors. Among the three oxides, V2O5 exhibits the
highest speciﬁc capacitance, but a quick capacitance decay during
cycling [28]. The asymmetric supercapacitors equipped with
Fe3O4 and MnO2 positive electrodes can operate up to 1.8 and 2 V,
respectively [21,22]. Taking into account that manganese oxide
demonstrates a higher capacitance than iron oxide [28], it seems
to be the most adapted oxide for the positive electrode of an
asymmetric supercapacitor in aqueous medium.
In
order
to
optimize
the
voltage
of
an
asymmetric
MnO2/activated carbon supercapacitor, Khomenko et al. [21]
have studied the pH inﬂuence in the range 6.4–10, and found
the largest theoretical cell voltage (2.1 V) at pH ≈ 6.4. A practical
voltage of 2 V has been validated in 0.1 mol L−1 K2SO4 (pH ≈ 7) by
galvanostatic charge/discharge cycling (195,000 cycles, with 12.5%
capacitance fade [22]). The speciﬁc capacitance of MnO2 seems
to be essentially controlled by the coating thickness. For thick
ﬁlms (≈100 �m), the capacitance value is only 150 F g−1, whereas
it reaches 1380 F g−1 for thin ﬁlms (<5 �m), which is close to the
theoretical value (1370 F g−1) [29]. Recently it has also been shown
that higher capacitance values (≈250 F g−1) can be obtained for
spinel like manganese oxide even for thick ﬁlms (≈200 �m) [30].
This contribution aims at optimizing the operating conditions
of an asymmetric MnO2/AC supercapacitor at pH = 6.4, e.g., in
0.5 mol L−1 Na2SO4. A MnO2/carbon nanotube (CNT) composite
[31] and a commercially available activated carbon were chosen
as active materials for the positive and negative electrode, respec-
tively. In order to take advantage of the largest voltage window,
the mass ratio (R) between the positive and the negative electrode
has been adjusted taking into account formula (2) which expresses
that the same charge is passed through both electrodes [21,22]:
R = m+
m−
= C− × �E−
C+ × �E+
(2)
where m+ and m− are the mass, C+ and C− the speciﬁc capaci-
tance, and �E+ and �E− the potential window for the positive and
negative electrodes, respectively. Then, the performance of asym-
metric cells was evaluated by varying R close to the value calculated
according to Eq. (2). Thanks to an asymmetric cell equipped with a
reference electrode, the potential range of each electrode during
cycling of the supercapacitor could be determined. Finally, gal-
vanostatic charge/discharge cycling was carried out to validate the
optimized mass ratio for an asymmetric supercapacitor working at
2 V.
2. Experimental
A high purity commercial activated carbon (AC, MWV-E510A
from MeadWestvaco, USA) was used for negative electrode. The
porous texture of the activated carbon was analysed by nitrogen
and CO2 adsorption at 77 and 273 K, respectively (Autosorb-
1, Quantachrome Instruments). Before the analysis, the sample
was degassed (Flo Vac Degasser, Quantachrome Instruments)
overnight at 200 ◦C. The speciﬁc surface area was calculated from
the N2 adsorption isotherm by applying the BET equation. The
micropore volume was calculated from the application of the
Dubinin–Radushkevich equation to the adsorption data up to P/P0
≤0.015 for N2 and P/P0 < 0.1 for CO2. Pore size distribution has been
obtained from the N2 adsorption data by applying the non-linear

differential functional theory (NL-DFT) equation. X-ray photoelec-
tron spectra (XPS) were recorded on the powder with a VG ESCALAB
250 spectrometer using an Al K� monochromatic source (15 kV,
15 mA) and a multidetection analyzer, under 10−8 Pa residual pres-
sure.
A paste was prepared by mixing the AC (80%), acetylene
black (Pure Black, Superior Graphite Co., USA, 10%) and PTFE
(10%) binder. A composite of amorphous manganese oxide (a-
MnO2·nH2O) with carbon nanotubes (CNTs, 15 wt%) was prepared
by adding Mn(OAc)2·4H2O to a suspension of CNTs (Baytubes,
Bayer, Germany) in aqueous KMnO4, according to reference [31].
The mixture was stirred during 6 h at ambient temperature; the
precipitated a-MnO2·nH2O/CNT composite was ﬁltered and thor-
oughly washed several times with distilled water, and ﬁnally
dried at 120 ◦C overnight. A paste was prepared by mixing the
composite (90 wt%) and PTFE (10 wt%). Both pastes of AC and a-
MnO2·nH2O/CNT composite were rolled up in order to obtain ﬁlms.
Electrodes were prepared by punching pellets (1 cm diameter) in
the AC and MnO2/CNT composite based pastes. Masses were com-
prised between 5–8 mg and 12–16 mg for the AC and MnO2/CNT
electrodes, respectively.

were assembled using a Teﬂon Swagelok® construction with gold
current collectors and glassy ﬁbrous separator. A special two-
electrode cell equipped with a Hg/Hg2SO4 reference electrode
(SME) was also used in order to determine the potential window
of each electrode during cycling the supercapacitor. For three-
electrode cell experiments, the auxiliary electrode was a graphite
rod and SME was the reference electrode. The two-electrode cells
were built with deaerated 0.5 mol L−1 Na2SO4, while the electrolyte
was not deaerated when the SME reference was used. All potentials
are further expressed versus the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE).

3. Results and discussion
The nitrogen adsorption isotherm of the activated carbon (AC)
(Fig. 1a) is characteristic of a microporous material with some
amount of mesopores favourable for ions transportation [5]. The
data extracted from this isotherm demonstrate a well-developed
porosity (Table 1). Fig. 1b shows a broad distribution of micropores
size, with pores ranging from ultramicropores to supermicropores.
Beside carbon, oxygen (2.4 at%) was the only element detected by
XPS on the surface of AC.
Fig. 2 presents the cyclic voltammograms (CV) of AC in non-
deaerated 0.5 mol L−1 Na2SO4 for different values of negative
potential cut-off, from −0.36 to −1.06 V vs. NHE. The vertical line
at −0.377 V vs. NHE corresponds to the equilibrium potential for
water reduction in 0.5 mol L−1 Na2SO4 (pH = 6.4). For the smallest
potential window, the voltammogram exhibits a quasi rectangular
shape, characteristic of a pure capacitive electrode, conﬁrming that

the amount of oxygenated surface groups is low. When the negative
potential cut-off decreases, few reduction humps appear at −0.2,
−0.6 and −0.85 V vs. NHE, respectively, during the negative poten-
tial sweep, while an oxidation wave centred at around 0.55 V vs.
NHE is observed during the positive potential scan. It must be noted
that the amplitude of the oxidation peak increases when the neg-
ative potential cut-off reaches lower values and that the hump at
−0.2 V vs. NHE is only observable for the two curves with the lowest
negative potential cut-off. Since the experiment was carried out in
non-deaerated medium, hydrogen peroxide species can be formed
at low potentials and may oxidize the carbon surface [32,33]. By
contrast, if CV was recorded in a deaerated medium, such peaks did
not appear. Therefore, the reduction hump at −0.2 V vs. NHE, e.g., at
higher potential than −0.377 V vs. NHE is attributed to the activity
of oxidized species formed during surface oxidation by hydrogen
peroxide. The redox peaks located at lower values than the poten-
tial for water reduction, e.g., −0.6 and −0.85 V vs. NHE, respectively,
can be ascribed to the reversible storage of nascent hydrogen at
the surface of the activated carbon [2,34]. During the operation of
a supercapacitor, these pseudofaradic contributions may enhance
the speciﬁc capacitance of the AC electrode, and the reversibility of
the process remains high as long as di-hydrogen is not produced.
The current leap appearing at potential values lower than −1 V vs.
NHE is ascribed to the formation of di-hydrogen at the surface of
the electrode. Consequently, the lowest potential limit for a super-
capacitor negative electrode based on AC in 0.5 mol L−1 Na2SO4 is

ent negative cut-off potential; scan rate 2 mV s−1.
about −0.96 V vs. NHE. In this electrolyte, the over-potential for
hydrogen evolution is around 0.6 V with AC, whereas an activated
carbon with a speciﬁc surface area of 1390 m2 g−1 and an oxygen
amount of ≈2.5 at% demonstrated over-potentials close to 0.35 and
0.1 V in 3 mol L−1 KOH and 3 mol L−1 H2SO4 electrolytes, respec-
tively [34].
Fig. 3 presents the CVs recorded for AC and for the MnO2/CNT
composite in their maximum stability window for the considered
electrolyte, e.g., 0.5 mol L−1 Na2SO4. As already explained in lit-
erature, the CV characteristics of the MnO2/CNT composite are
essentially related to reversible pseudo-faradic transitions involv-
ing ions exchange with the electrolyte [29]. It clearly appears that
the two materials reversibly operate in a different potential range.
In other words, by implementing them in an asymmetric super-
capacitor, one can expect to extend the voltage window by an
appropriate equilibration of electrodes mass.
Considering the MnO2/CNT composite, the potential window
is limited by Mn(IV) to Mn(VII) oxidation for the highest limit (at
1.19 V vs. NHE) and Mn(IV) to Mn(II) reduction for the lowest limit
(at 0.47 V vs. NHE) [35], which implies a maximum theoretical win-
dow of 0.72 V for the positive electrode (�EMnO2) of the asymmetric
supercapacitor [21]. According to Fig. 3, the lowest limit for avoid-
ing di-hydrogen production at the negative AC electrode should
be around −0.96 V vs. NHE. All limits are presented on this ﬁgure
by full vertical lines, and �EAC and �EMnO2 represent the theo-
retical potential variations that both electrodes should undergo,

respectively, in an asymmetric system. The speciﬁc capacitance,
estimated from the CVs (Fig. 3) is 178 and 179 F g−1 for the AC and
MnO2/CNT composite electrodes, respectively. Then, according to
Eq. (2), the theoretical R between the positive MnO2 and negative
AC electrodes is around 2.
Electrochemical investigations were carried out with an elec-
trode mass ratio R = 2 and using a two-electrode cell where a
reference electrode was added; in such a way, the operating poten-
tial of each electrode and E0 V, corresponding to the electrodes
potential when the cell voltage is 0, could be determined as function
of voltage. Fig. 4(a) presents the extreme potential reached by both
electrodes when the cell is galvanostatically cycled from 0 V (E0 V)
up to different voltage values. For a voltage of 2 V, the E0 V value
is around 0.65 V vs. NHE, which is higher than the expected value
of 0.47 V vs. NHE from Fig. 3. Consequently, the operating window
of the MnO2/CNT positive electrode is noticeably diminished, and
its maximum potential in Fig. 4(a) reaches the positive limit for
Mn(IV) oxidation at a voltage of 1.7 V which is lower than the value
of 2–2.1 V expected from three-electrode cell investigations (Fig. 3).
Considering Fig. 3, it is also interesting to note that the E0 V value
(0.65 V vs. NHE) is higher than the oxidation potential of hydrogen.
For this reason, a pseudo-capacitive contribution is added to the
classical double layer capacitance of AC, leading to a higher spe-
ciﬁc capacitance value of 190 F g−1 at the negative electrode. Due
to these two features and according to Eq. (2), the theoretical R = 2
is underestimated.
Fig. 4(b) and (c) present the extreme potential of the electrodes
vs. voltage for mass ratios of 2.5 and 3, respectively. By comparison
with Fig. 4(a), it is now clear that the maximum acceptable potential
for the MnO2/CNT electrode is reached for a higher voltage, while
the minimum potential of the AC electrode is extended towards
more negative values. Both mass ratios seem better adapted for this
system and may allow cell voltages of 2 V or more to be reached.

CVs exhibit a rectangular shape, characteristic of an ideal capacitive
behaviour. At higher voltage windows, an increase of capacitance
is observed at high voltage and a wave appears during the negative
sweep around 0.5 V. As shown in Fig. 4(b) and (c), at voltage higher
than 1.45 V, the potential of the negative electrode becomes lower
than the thermodynamic limit for water reduction (−0.377 V vs.
NHE) and hydrogen is stored. Therefore, the current leap above

negative scan are essentially due to hydrogen storage in AC and its
reversible oxidation [34], respectively. However, the redox features
are more pronounced for the capacitor built with R = 2.5 (Fig. 5).
Since the maximum potential of the positive electrode is higher in
Fig. 4(b) than in (c), partial oxidation of Mn(IV) into Mn(VII) and
the subsequent reversible reduction may contribute to the more
pronounced redox humps for R = 2.5 in Fig. 5(a).
Fig. 6 presents the galvanostatic charge–discharge characteris-
tics obtained for asymmetric supercapacitors built with R = 2.5 or
3. For a maximum voltage lower than 1.7 V, the curves are close to
an isosceles triangle which is characteristic of an ideal capacitive
behaviour with a good coulombic efﬁciency. When the maximum
voltage increases, the shape of the curves is modiﬁed due to the
redox processes linked with hydrogen storage and change of man-
ganese oxidation state.
From these results, the coulombic efﬁciency � was determined
according to Eq. (3):
� = qd

,
(3)
where qd and qc are the total discharge and charge capacity of the
cell, respectively. The speciﬁc capacitance CS was also determined
according to Eq. (4):
CS = 4 C
m ,
(4)
where C is the capacitance of the cell and m the total mass of the
two electrodes. The voltage dependence of speciﬁc capacitance (per
total mass of electrodes material) and of coulombic efﬁciency is
presented in Fig. 7 for asymmetric cells with R = 2.5 and 3 in deaer-
ated 0.5 mol L−1 Na2SO4. According to Fig. 4, the fast increase of
capacitance together with the coulombic efﬁciency decay for max-

imum voltage higher than ≈1.9–2.1 V are essentially attributed to
the onset of the Mn(IV) → Mn(VII) transformation at the positive
electrode. These effects occur at lower voltage for the cell with
R = 2.5 because the potential of the positive electrode is shifted to
slightly higher values. From the data shown in Fig. 7, the high-
est voltage values are 2 and 2.2 V for the cells with R = 2.5 and 3,
respectively.
In order to evaluate the cycle life of the asymmetric systems,
cells built with R = 2.5 and 3 were charged/discharged galvanos-
tatically at 1 A g−1 (Fig. 8). A deaerated electrolyte was used to
improve the stability of the supercapacitors during cycling [22]. For
R = 2.5 and U = 2 V, capacitance ﬁrst increases, further decreases and
reaches stabilization; the initial capacitance is close to 100 F g−1,
then reaches more than 120 F g−1 after 1700 cycles and decreases
to stabilize around the initial value of 100 F g−1 after 6000 cycles.
For R = 3 and U = 2 V, the trend is comparable with smaller values.
Keeping R = 3 and increasing the maximum voltage to 2.1 V leads
to a dramatic degradation of the performance (Fig. 8). Although a
good coulombic efﬁciency was observed up to 2.2 V for this ratio
(Fig. 7), Fig. 8 demonstrates that monitoring the cycle life is the
only way for validating a system and its operating parameters. In
conclusion, R = 2.5 and a maximum voltage U = 2 V are the optimal
conditions for the asymmetric cells based on AC and MnO2/CNT
composite. Under these conditions, the energy density determined
according to Eq. (1) reaches 13.9 Wh kg−1 of total electrode mate-
rials, that is slightly higher than the value determined by Brousse
et al. (11.7 Wh kg−1) [22].
To the best of our knowledge, such trend in speciﬁc capacitance
variation has not been observed previously during the galvanostatic
cycling of MnO2/AC cells. Since the evolution is more pronounced

for higher operating voltage, it is probably related with the fact
that the electrodes potential reach values beyond the limits shown
in Fig. 4. According to this ﬁgure, it seems that the MnO2/CNT
composite electrode reaches the limit before the AC electrode.
Electrode rearrangements due to oxide dissolution and precipita-
tion could be at the origin of the particular evolution of speciﬁc
capacitance during cycling. Therefore, post-mortem SEM charac-
terizations were performed on MnO2/CNT composite electrodes
after different numbers of galvanostatic (1 A g−1) charge/discharge
cycles up to 2 V on asymmetric cells built with R = 2.5 (Fig. 9). In
Fig. 9(a) the fresh electrode presents a compact cauliﬂower surface
morphology. After 2000 cycles (Fig. 9(b)), the morphology is slightly
modiﬁed and small needle-like particles are observed at the surface
of the cauliﬂower structure. In parallel to the modiﬁcation to this
less compact structure, the speciﬁc capacitance increases (Fig. 8)
probably because of an increase of speciﬁc surface area. After 4000
cycles (Fig. 9(c)), the needles are better deﬁned due to a diameter
increase; the slow capacitance decay in Fig. 8 can be interpreted by
a decrease of speciﬁc surface area. For a higher number of cycles,
the MnO2/CNT electrode remained glued to the gold current collec-
tor, which indicates another electrode transformation. After 6000
cycles, a petal-like morphology is observed (Fig. 9(d)). From the
forward, these morphological transformations are due to MnO2 dis-
solution/precipitation when the potential of the positive electrode
is high enough for allowing MnO2 to be oxidized into Mn(VII).
In order to support this interpretation, an asymmetric superca-
pacitor with R = 2.5 was cycled up to U = 1.6 V. After 10,000 cycles,
the surface morphology of the positive electrode is still compact
(Fig. 9(e)) and not very different from the fresh electrode. Dur-
ing cycling, the speciﬁc capacitance of the cell increases, reaching
88 F g−1 after 3500 cycles and remains stable (Fig. 8). Hence, these
results conﬁrm that the speciﬁc capacitance variations at U ≥ 2 V
586

must be attributed to structural modiﬁcations of the positive elec-
trode which occur when its potential reaches values allowing
Mn(IV) to be oxidized.
4. Conclusion
We demonstrated that the performance of an asymmetric
MnO2/AC supercapacitor operating in 0.5 mol L−1 Na2SO4 can be
improved by optimizing the mass ratio between the positive and
negative electrode. Based on the equivalence of charge passed
through both electrodes and assuming that E0 V is linked to the
Mn(IV) → Mn(II) reduction, a theoretical mass ratio R = 2 was esti-
mated. In practice, with R = 2, the E0 V determined in a MnO2/AC
cell with an added reference electrode is higher than the estimated
value. Consequently, the mass ratio calculated by this assump-
tion was underestimated. In this work, the best performance was
obtained with R = 2.5 and U = 2 V, allowing the extremum potential
values for both electrodes to be close to the acceptable stability
values.
This work also revealed the necessity of long-term galvanos-
tatic charge/discharge cycling for validating a system. Although
U = 2.2 V seemed to be reachable from short time experiments,
galvanostatic cycling revealed that the maximum voltage for this
system is 2 V. At this voltage, the morphological transformations
of the positive electrode do not seem deleterious for the perfor-
mance. At higher voltage, the MnO2/CNT electrode is considerably
transformed due to Mn(IV) → Mn(VII) oxidation. By contrast, dur-
ing cycling at U = 1.6 V, the morphology of the positive electrode
remains unchanged and the capacitance of the system did not
decay.
For future optimizations of the AC/MnO2 capacitor, it is manda-
tory to design positive electrodes with enhanced capacitance in
order to reduce the value of R.
