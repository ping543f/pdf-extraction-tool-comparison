			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Supercapacitor electrodes and devices that utilise conducting polymers are envisaged to bridge the gap between existing carbon-based supercapacitors and batteries to form units of intermediate specific energy. This review looks at the major conducting polymer materials, namely, polyaniline, polypyrrole, polythiophene and derivatives of polythiophene, as well as composites of these materials with carbon nanotubes and inorganic battery materials. Various treatments of the conducting polymer materials to improve their properties are considered and comparisons are made with other supercapacitor materials such as carbon and with inorganic battery materials. Conducting polymers are pseudo-capacitive materials, which means that the bulk of the material undergoes a fast redox reaction to provide the capacitive response and they exhibit superior specific energies to the carbon-based supercapacitors (double-layer capacitors). In general conducting polymers are more conductive than the inorganic battery materials and consequently have greater power capability. On the downside, conducting polymers swell and contract substantially on charge and discharge, respectively. Consequently, cycle-life is poor compared with carbon-based supercapacitors which generally only charge via adsorption and desorption of ions (giving typically a few thousand cycles for conducting polymers compared with &gt;500 000 cycles for carbon-based devices).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>market both in hybrid electric vehicles and pure electric vehicles to improve regenerative braking (through fast charge capability) and deliver larger acceleration (through fast discharge capability). Traditionally, capacitors have been constructed using a set of parallel conducting plates separated by an insulator. Capacitive charge of opposite sign builds up on the respective plates in response to a voltage difference between them. The capacitances are delivered in mF and F quantities <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. In more recent times, capacitors have been developed that give hundreds to thousands of Farads and these are usually known as supercapacitors, or ultracapacitors, and were initially constructed from carbons of high surface area <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. These are in fact two capacitors connected in series with a conducting liquid media linking them. Such a supercapacitor device derives its performance from a so-called double-layer capacitance and is therefore often referred to as an (electric or) electrochemical double-layer capacitor (EDLC). The capacitance in these devices is stored as a build up of charge in the electrical double-layer in the solution interface close to the surface of the carbon to balance the charge in the carbon material.</p><p>Another type of supercapacitor, referred to as a pseudocapacitor, derives its capacitance from the storage of charge in the bulk of a redox material in response to a redox reaction. This fast redox reaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> acts like capacitance (hence the name pseudocapacitance). A pseudo-capacitor typically stores a greater amount of capacitance per gram than an EDLC, as the bulk of the material (not just the surface layer) reacts. On the other hand, an EDLC has faster kinetics as only the surface of the carbon is being accessed. An example of a pseudo-capacitive material is a conducting polymer (CP) (the conductivity of which was first reported in 1963 by Weiss and co-workers in Australia <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and first utilised in supercapacitors in the mid 1990s <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>) and it is this material that will be the subject of this review. The review will focus on work done post-2000 but for a comprehensive description of work pre-2000 readers should consult Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The concept of 'bridging the gap' with batteries to form conducting-polymer-based supercapacitors with superior specific energy compared with carbon-based alternatives is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>Conducting polymers are rendered conductive through a conjugated bond system along the polymer backbone. They are typically formed either through chemical oxidation of the monomer (for example with iron chloride) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> or electrochemical oxidation of the monomer. Two oxidation reactions occur simultaneously -the oxidation of the monomer and the oxidation of the polymer <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> with the coincident insertion of a dopant/counter ion (e.g. Cl − ). The dopant or doping level (in this p-type conducting polymer) is typically below 1 dopant per polymer unit: approximately 0.3-0.5, i.e., 2-3 monomer units per dopant. This is limited by how closely the positive charges (so-called polarons) can be spaced along the polymer chain. The polymers that are most commonly studied for use in supercapacitor devices are polypyrrole, polyaniline, and derivatives of polythiophene <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. The typical dopant level for these polymers, as well as their typical specific capacitances and voltage ranges, are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p><p>The difference between EDLCs and conducting-polymer-based supercapacitors is shown schematically in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. In general, carbon- based supercapacitors have high power capabilities, due to the fast sorption and desorption of ions, but a low specific energy <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Conducting polymers should improve the device as they undergo a redox reaction to store charge in the bulk of the material and thereby increase the energy stored and reduce self-discharge. One significant drawback of these materials is the relatively low power (or lower rate of charge-discharge) due to the slow diffusion of ions within the bulk of the electrode. Nevertheless, it is still proposed that conducting polymers can bridge the gap between batteries and double-layer supercapacitors as these electrodes have better kinetics than nearly all inorganic battery electrode materials (pseudo-capacitive materials) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>Conducting polymers are generally attractive as they have high charge density and low cost (compared with the relatively expensive metal oxides) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. It is possible to develop devices with low equivalent series resistance (ESR), high power, and high energy <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Polyaniline can exhibit a charge density of 140 mAh g −1 , which is slightly lower than that obtained with expensive metal oxides such as LiCoO 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref> but much higher than that given by carbon devices that often deliver less than 15 mAh g −1 (perhaps ∼40 mAh g −1 for the individual electrode) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Carbon-carbon symmetric supercapacitor devices can achieve a specific power of 3-4 kW kg −1 and a specific energy of 3-5 Wh kg −1 when fully packaged <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>, while a conducting polymer supercapacitor, based on polyaniline, can achieve a slightly lower power at 2 kW kg −1 but double the specific energy (10 Wh kg −1 ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. As will be discussed in Section 3, the weight used for the calculation of specific energy Cited from Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Mw is molecular weight per unit monomer (g mol −1 ), PAni is polyaniline, PPy is polypyrrole, PTh is polythiophene and PEDOT is poly <ref type="bibr">(3,4ethylenedioxythiophene)</ref>.</p><p>a Cited from Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. and power is often not specified. That is whether it is the weight of device, packaged device, electrode or active material. This makes comparison of different supercapacitor performances difficult. Double-layer capacitors are highly cycleable, namely, &gt;0.5 million cycles <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> whereas conducting polymer pseudo-capacitors often begin to degrade under less than a thousand cycles due to changes in their physical structure that are caused by the doping/de-doping (intercalation/deintercalation) of ions <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Higher specific energies may be achieved with conducting polymer electrodes by increasing the doping level. This comes at a cost, due to a larger degree of counter ion insertion and de-insertion with an accompanying volume change <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. This volume change, or swelling, causes mechanical failure of the electrode under prolonged cycling. Interestingly, results using conducting polymer electrodes with electrolytes based on ionic liquids <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref> show that the electrodes perform better with greater life times, especially in actuators <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> where doping and undoping of ions into the polymer is required for the shape changes. The preparation of both conducting polymer electrodes and devices with ionic liquid electrolytes will be discussed later in more detail. Conducting polymers are attractive because they have good intrinsic conductivity, namely, from a few S cm −1 to 500 S cm −1 in the doped state <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref> as can be seen in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. Conducting polymers have low band-gaps (1-3 eV) compared with conventional polymers (10 eV) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. They have relatively fast charge-discharge kinetics, suitable morphology, and fast doping and undoping processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Conducting polymers also have plastic properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and are therefore easily manufactured, particularly as thin films.</p><p>Conducting polymers can be p-doped with (counter) anions when oxidised and n-doped with (counter) cations when reduced. The simplified equations for these two charging processes are as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Cp → Cp n+ (A − ) n + ne − (p-doping) (1) Cp + ne − → (C + ) n Cp n− (n-doping) (2)</formula><p>The discharge reactions are, of course, the reverse of the above equations. Complications can occur given that on oxidation a certain degree of cation inclusion (mixed doping) is possible under certain circumstances. Examples of p-and n-dopable thiophenebased conducting polymers are listed in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>, along with the voltage ranges in which these processes occur. Supercapacitor devices made solely from conducting polymers can have three configurations <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>:</p><p>Type I (symmetric) using the same p-dopable polymer for both electrodes. Type II (asymmetric) using two different p-dopable polymers with a different range of electroactivity. Type III (symmetric) using the same polymer for both electrodes with the p-doped form used as the positive electrode and the ndoped form used as the negative electrode.</p><p>In addition, asymmetric (or hybrid) devices using a conducting polymer positive electrode and carbon or lithium-based negative electrode can be constructed <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>.</p><p>A Type III device based entirely on conducting polymers is the most attractive. Theoretically, it should be highly conductive in the charged state as both electrodes will be doped (i.e. the negative is n-doped and the positive is p-doped) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. In addition the charge is released at higher potentials (up to at least 3 V) compared with Type I and Type II devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>. This higher potential range should result in high specific energy and power due to the 1/2CV 2 relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. In reality, these types of conducting polymer supercapacitor devices do not perform as well as expected due to the difficulty of the n-doping process.</p><p>Early studies of n-doped materials were performed on polyacetylene (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3a-b</ref>) and later poly-p-phenylene <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3c</ref>).</p><p>Table <ref type="table">3</ref> p-and n-doping of various thiophene derivatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.  These polymers have high impedances upon n-doping and are therefore not suitable for use as negative electrodes. Many conducting polymers, such as polyaniline and polypyrrole, can only be p-doped due to the very negative potentials required for n-doping, when compared with the reduction potential limit of molecular solvent-based electrolytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. A purified electrolyte or a roomtemperature ionic liquid <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> with a wide electrochemical window, particularly at negative potentials, is required for n-doping <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>An example of a promising n-dopable material is polythiophene and its derivatives. Polythiophene itself is not n-dopable in acetonitrile <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> as the potential for n-doping is more negative than the breakdown potential of the solvent at below −2.0 V vs. Ag|Ag + <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>. Substitution at the 3-position with an aryl group results in more positive n-doping potentials. These polymers are not very conductive in the reduced state (at more negative potentials) and have a low capacitance in this potential region. Consequently, they are usually only employed as the positive electrode with a negative electrode made from another material such as carbon <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>.</p><p>The properties of conducting polymers can be greatly enhanced by forming composites between the conducting polymer and other materials such as carbon (including carbon nanotubes) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, inorganic oxides and hydroxides <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>, and other metal compounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. Examples of some of these composites and their electrochemical properties are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref>. These electrodes can allow the device to be made symmetric (Type I or Type III) with the same positive and negative electrode. The composite materials have improved conductivity (particularly at the more negative/reducing potentials) and better cycleability, mechanical stability, specific capacitance and processability <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. This review will focus on the main conducting polymers used for supercapacitor devices, namely, polyaniline, polypyrrole and derivatives of polythiophene, together with the use of composites to improve the properties of these conducting polymer materials. Finally, a comparison with other types of supercapacitor materials will be made.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Discussion</head><p>The three main methods used for determining the capacitance of conducting polymer materials are illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>, namely, constant-current charge-discharge, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Ideally, the charge-discharge curve for a capacitor should be linear with a slope equal to the current divided by the capacitance. Calculation of capacitance from this data is given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4a</ref>. In the absence of redox processes, the cyclic voltammogram of a capacitor should be rectangular with the capacitance roughly equal to half the value of the difference in plateau currents divided by the scan rate, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4b</ref>. Finally, the low-frequency components of EIS data represent the capacitive region and a plot such as Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4c</ref> can be used to determine the capacitance. There are, however, other ways of extracting capacitance from EIS measurements, e.g., modelling the data with equivalent circuits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Polyaniline</head><p>Polyaniline has been studied extensively as a supercapacitor or battery electrode material <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>. The structure of polyaniline is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3d</ref>. Polyaniline has many desirable properties for use in a supercapacitor device; it has high electroactivity, a high doping level (0.5 -see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), excellent stability and a high specific capacitance (400-500 F g −1 in an acidic medium) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. In addition, it has good environmental stability, controllable electrical conductivity (around 0.1 S cm −1 in the doped state with a Li dopant, but can range from around 0.1 to S cm −1 as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>), and can be easily processed <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. A major disadvantage of polyaniline is that it requires a proton to be properly charged and discharged; therefore a protic solvent, an acidic solution or a protic ionic liquid is required <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>.</p><p>Polyaniline has been reported to have a wide capacity range from 44 to 270 mAh g −1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. This variation in capacity is related to many factors, including synthetic route used, polymer morphology, the amount and type of binders and additives, and the thickness of the electrode. Polyaniline has the most variable specific capacitance of all conducting polymers; the specific capacitance achievable is higher for electrodeposited than for chemically formed polyaniline.</p><p>It has been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> that the cycle-life of polyaniline for a Li-doped positive electrode was over 5000 cycles, during which the specific capacitance dropped from 100 to 70 F g −1 . In another study <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, polyaniline doped with LiPF achieved a specific capacitance of 107 F g −1 that decreased to 84 F g −1 after 9000 cycles.</p><p>A device has been constructed with polyaniline as the positive electrode and carbon as the negative <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, i.e., a so-called hybrid electrochemical capacitor. According to Park and Park <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> their device gives similar or higher values than recently reported Type III supercapacitors made from polythiophene derivatives. A constantcurrent charge-discharge (0.5 mA cm −2 ) test yields 380 F g −1 , a specific energy of 18 Wh kg −1 and a specific power of 1.25 kW kg −1 (at 20 mA cm −2 ). Using cyclic voltammetry, a cycle-life of 4000 cycles was observed. The device charges between 1.25 and 1.5 V and discharges between 1.4 and 1.0 V.</p><p>Polyaniline can be modified to make it more stable by forming poly(n-methyl aniline) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3e</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. In this polymer, the proton exchange sites are blocked by the methyl groups, so that the polymer is stabilised against chemical degradation and made more redox active. A combination of this conducting polymer with a lithium negative electrode can achieve a capacity of 52 mAh g −1 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Polypyrrole</head><p>Polypyrrole offers a greater degree of flexibility in electrochemical processing than most conducting polymers <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>, and consequently the material has been the subject of much research as a supercapacitor or battery electrode <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>. On the downside, polypyrrole (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3f</ref>) cannot be n-doped like the thiophene derivatives, and thus it has only found use as a cathode material.</p><p>Due its greater density, polypyrrole has a high capacitance per unit volume (400-500 F cm −3 ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref>. One disadvantageous aspect of the dense growth is that it leads to limited access to the interior sites of the polymer for dopant ions. This reduces the capacitance per gram, especially for thicker coatings on electrodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref>. Polypyrrole is typically doped with single-charged anions such as Cl − , ClO 4 − and SO 3 − but if doped with multiple-charged anions, e.g. SO 4 2− , physical crosslinking of the polymer occurs <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. According to Suematsu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, the cross-linked materials have high diffusivity and higher capacitance, presumably due to the greater porosity of the growth. Suematsu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> do not back up this statement by quoting the specific capacitance of the material; only capacitance per unit volume of material is quoted and is lower (100-200 F cm −3 ) than typically denser polypyrrole layers (400-500 F cm −3 ), as expected.</p><p>Combining polypyrrole with polyimide (a dopant of high molecular weight) is claimed to improve the charge storage properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref>, due to the polyimide matrix protecting the polypyrrole from oxidative degradation and the polyimide is cathodically electroactive (whereas polypyrrole is anodically electroactive). Polyimide has excellent thermal stability and very good mechanical properties. No details as to how the material performed as a supercapacitor electrode were given, except for EIS data that was used to examine the capacitive behaviour.

As a consequence, it has high self-discharge (i.e., it is easily oxidised back to the neutral form) and has low cycle-life in devices.

Lota et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> claim a capacitance of 180 F g −1 is possible with PEDOT, but the authors reported this value for a thin film that is impractical for energy-storage purposes. When the authors prepared a pellet (10-20 mg), the PEDOT gave a capacitance of 80-100 F g −1 , as expected. Another disadvantage of this polymer is that the monomer cannot be dissolved in aqueous solvents. Consequently, a volatile and toxic organic solvent, such as acetonitrile, is generally used to deposit the polymer.

Consequently, less charge is released on discharge than on charge. Laforgue et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108]</ref> constructed a conducting polymer/carbon/binder electrode and observed charge trapping in initial cycles, but this decreased with continued cycling <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108]</ref>.

For PFPT, cyclic voltammetry for over 500 cycles resulted in little loss in capacity. In other work on PFPT by Rudge et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, it was found that n-doping was more facile at a higher electrolyte concentration with smaller ions, but the ability to n-dope was hindered when using highly solvated alkali metal salts in acetonitrile.

In organic media, the PEDOT/PSS material does not swell and this indicates a high ionic resistance and a slow electrochemical process <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107]</ref>. Blending this composite material (PEDOT/PSS) with polyethyleneoxide (PEO), which is an ionic conductor, improves the ionic conductivity of PEDOT. The PEO phase swells in acetonitrile to allow easier ion motion. Using 50% PEDOT-PSS/PEO, a specific power of 100 W kg −1 is achieved and appears to be a very small. Regardless, the authors claimed that the PEDOT-PSS formed a highly porous structure that results in very fast and efficient electrochemical reaction.

A specific energy of 3.3 kJ kg −1 translates to a specific energy of 0.92 Wh kg −1 . This value appears to be low compared to the specific capacitance achieved. It also appears that the specific capacitance may have been reported on the basis of conducting polymer weight and not composite weight. CNTs are electron acceptors and PPy is an electron donor so the two form a charge-transfer complex. One of the electrodes gave a capacitance of 205 F g −1 at 0.4 A g −1 and 50 F g −1 at 2.5 A g −1 . This drop in capacity is due to the inaccessibility of the composite electrode material. Even though the composite structure is more open than PPy itself, it must not be sufficiently open to allow such high currents to be passed through the structure. The best electrode prepared by these authors gave a performance of 350 F g −1 at 0.4 A g −1 and 200 F g −1 at 30 A g −1 .</p><p>Polypyrrole can be co-deposited with carbon nanotubes by oxidising the monomer in the presence of negatively charged multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>. In the absence of any other dopant, the polymer will be doped by these nanotubes <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>. The carbon nanotubes are made by treatment in an aqueous acid solution to form charged groups such as carboxylate, hydroxide and nitrous groups on the surface of the carbon. A monomer concentration of 0.5 M is used with a range of nanotube concentrations, namely, 0.025-0.4 wt% MWNTs. As the concentration of the MWNTs increases, the thickness of the polymer coating on the MWNT decreases. When combining with 0.4 wt% MWNTs, the polymer layer gave a mass specific capacitance of 190 F g −1 with an electrode specific capacitance of 2.1 F cm −2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>. The mass specific capacitance is slightly lower than that for pure PPy, however, the electrode specific capacitance is quite high as generally PPy is limited to about 0.7 F cm −2 . This is due to a more open or porous structure resulting from the MWNT backbone.</p><p>Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[124]</ref>, found that polypyrrole on its own exhibited a plateau in capacitance with increasing film thickness (at 10 C cm −2 ) and thereby indicated limited access to the interior redox sites. Combining PPy with carbon nanotubes resulted in a linear capacitance versus deposition charge up to the same film thickness (10 C cm −2 ). This suggests that the nanotubes open the structure and limit the thickness of the deposited PPy and thus allow the majority of internal sites to be accessed by ions.</p><p>Combining polythiophene with carbon nanotubes as a composite <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> results in improved cycleability and stability. This is due to the fact that the entangled mesoporous network of nanotubes, which supports the polymer structure, allows the material to adapt to volume changes, so that the open network structure does not need to expand and contract as much. The volume change, which can cause great stresses, is often the cause of poor cycleability.</p><p>Combining PEDOT with carbon means that there is no need for polymeric binders and that conductivity in the undoped state is improved <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">101]</ref>. The PEDOT, like most conducting polymers, is poorly conducting in the reduced state, so by combining with highly conductive carbon, the conductivity at these reducing potentials is increased.

In a study by Lota et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, composite electrodes were prepared by three different methods: (i) direct polymerisation on ultrasonically dispersed CNTs (130 F g −1 ), (ii) mixing of polymer with carbon nanotubes (composite capacitance of 120 F g −1 ), and (iii) electrochemical deposition of polymer onto the CNTs (up to 150 F g −1 ). In separate work <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[101]</ref>, a fourth method was used where a negatively charged CNT suspension and the polymer were co-deposited <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref> as in previous work by Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">85,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">124]</ref>.

A symmetric supercapacitor <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> with electrodes made of 75 wt% PEDOT/25 wt% CNT degraded by only 5 F g −1 (from 85 F g −1 ) in 3000 cycles, but the device had a limited operating potential of 0.8 V. An asymmetric device using 80 wt% PEDOT/20 wt% acetylene black as the positive electrode and activated carbon as the negative gave an extremely good cycle-life with little loss in capacitance after 20 000 cycles (160 F g −1 ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.9.">Comparison with other types of supercapacitor materials</head><p>A comparison of the specific capacitances of conducting polymer and conducting polymer composites with other supercapacitor materials is given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5</ref>. It is obvious that both conducting polymer and metal oxide materials (generally referred to as pseudo-capacitors) increase the amount of specific capacitance available for a device when compared with carbon-based supercapacitor materials, but this is generally at the sacrifice of cycle-life. The other notable point, at the opposite end of the scale, is that ruthenium oxide is capable of giving specific capacitances that are far superior to those of all other materials. In reality, however, ruthenium oxide is far too expensive to be a practical option for supercapacitors. Polyaniline is the most promising material when considering the specific capacitance of conducting polymers materials. The specific capacitance can, however, vary significantly depending on the method of production of the polymer. Moreover, utilisation of polyaniline as a supercapacitor material is complicated by the requirement for sufficient proton activity in the electrolyte solution to give satisfactory cycling. A variety of values for manganese oxide are given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5</ref> and this is because capacitance is dependent on the phase, morphology and form of the oxide that vary according to the method of synthesis. Nevertheless, this material appears to be the greatest competitor to conducting polymers as a supercapacitor material. Specific capacitances comparable to that of polyaniline are possible with the other conducting polymer materials by making a composite with, for example, PEDOT and iron oxide. The advantages of such a composite is that the specific capacitance is high and the flexible nature of the film assists the production of devices. Other conducting polymer composites (for example with carbon materials) often do not result in greater specific capacitances, but have many other advantages such as increased cycle-lives and charge rates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Conclusions</head><p>Conducting polymers offer many advantages as supercapacitor electrodes. They are flexible, highly conductive, easily processable and can be made into films. Many conducting polymers exhibit high specific capacities and capacitances, while being able to deliver energy at a relatively rapid rate. The major disadvantage of the conducting polymers when used as supercapacitor electrode is poor cycle-life. In general, symmetric supercapacitors based on conducting polymers will have a lower cycle-life than those based on carbon. This is unavoidable, because as anions or cations are doped or undoped into the conducting polymer, there is a corresponding volume change of the electrode when compared with carbon supercapacitors which involve only simple ion sorption and desorption. The literature tends to give vague reports of cycle-life of conducting polymer devices. Authors claim 'little' loss in capacitance over thousands of cycles but the depth of these cycles is usually not quoted. The main strategies for improving cycle-life include irradiation or sonication during production, or compositing the conducting polymer with carbon nanotubes to increase volume, improve porosity and allow room for swelling of the conducting polymer. A more recent method for increasing porosity and influencing the morphology of the conducting polymer electrode materials has involved co-deposition of different conducting polymers in an ionic liquid. It is anticipated that this should also increase cycle-life due to a greater degree of freedom to accommodate swelling of the electrode and a smaller amount of continuous thick conducting polymer material.</p><p>A degree of caution with over interpreting specific capacitance, energy and power data in the literature has to be applied. This is due to the fact that many numbers quoted are not device values and quite often relate only to the active material and do not include the mass of the binders, conductive carbon fillers, electrolyte and packaging. Again, this makes comparison of numbers in the literature often difficult.</p><p>Many investigations focus on mass specific properties and quote values per mass of active material. Often, however, the more important parameter is the area specific values for the devices. In other words, often (electrode) area specific capacitance (F cm −2 ) can be just as important as mass specific capacitance (F g −1 ). This means that the amount of capacitance for a given electrode geometric area will give an idea as to the device capacitance that is possible. In this respect, PEDOT is superior to many other conducting polymers due to its high porosity and deep accessibility of ions to the interior sites of the polymer layer. This means that while having a low mass specific capacitance (typically 90-100 F g −1 ) it can still produce a large electrode specific capacitance (well in excess of 5 F cm −2 ), which will translate to a large absolute device capacitance.</p><p>It should be noted, that the chemical method of deposition is limited in terms of how much polymer can be produced as a film. Consequently, this method is most often only suitable for thin films. If the capacitance of these thin films is converted to capacitance per area of electrode the value is lower when compared to carbon-based supercapacitors. On the other hand, the use of electrochemical deposition methods yields thicker deposits of the conducting polymer that lead to broader peaks in the cyclic voltammograms and thereby suggesting slower kinetics. Consequently, only small geometrical area prototypes of supercapacitors have been made with conducting polymers and new strategies need to be devised to make both electrodes and devices with high specific capacitances. It is proposed that room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) will play an important part in harnessing the power of conducting polymers in supercapacitor devices. Furthermore, RTILs will most likely increase the cycle-life of the conducting polymer materials in supercapacitor devices.</p><p>Conducting polymers are most promising for supercapacitors with asymmetric configurations, i.e., with a conducting-polymerbased positive electrode and a carbon-based negative electrode. These devices appear to have much greater cycle-life as the conducting polymer electrode experiences a smaller voltage swing. Also, a range of composites, in particular with carbon-based materials, are promising in terms of improving the characteristics of the positive electrode. When comparing such materials with metal oxides, they can achieve comparable specific capacitance at an appreciably lower cost and with the added benefit of superior mechanical properties and often also superior conductive properties. For these reasons, conducting polymers are promising supercapacitor materials.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Introduction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .12.
